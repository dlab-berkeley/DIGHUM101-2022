  Introduction 
1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, established in accordance with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its twentieth session from 27 October to 7 November 2014. The review of San Marino was held at the 6th meeting, on 29 October 2014. The delegation of San Marino was headed by Pasquale Valentini, Minister for Foreign Affairs. At its 10th meeting, held on 31 October 2014, the Working Group adopted the report on San Marino. 

2. On 15 January 2014, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of San Marino: Burkina Faso, Chile, China. 

3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1 and paragraph 5 of the annex to resolution 16/21, the following documents were issued for the review of San Marino: 


(a) A national report submitted/written presentation prepared in accordance with paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/20/SMR/1); 
(b) A compilation prepared by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) (A/HRC/WG.6/20/SMR/2); 
(c) A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) (A/HRC/WG.6/20/SMR/3). 
4. A list of questions prepared in advance by Liechtenstein, Mexico, the Netherlands, Slovenia, Spain and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland was transmitted to San Marino through the troika. These questions are available on the extranet of the universal periodic review (UPR). 


 I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
 A. Presentation by the State under review 
5. The delegation of San Marino presented its report for the second cycle of the UPR on the human rights situation. 

6. The delegation noted that, in July 2014, it had presented the national report prepared by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in collaboration with the Ministries of Internal Affairs, Health, Labour and Education and other government offices. It stated that the national report included the steps taken to implement the recommendations accepted during the first review, noting that several provisions adopted in recent years had been based on those recommendations.  

7. The delegation explained the approach that San Marino had always held towards the protection of human rights in the context of its Declaration on the CitizensÕ Rights and Fundamental Principles of San Marino Constitutional Order. The delegation stated that San Marino was one of the few States that, in the field of human rights, did not need internal implementation rules, as international law was an integral part of national law, and even superseded this in the event of any conflict.  

8. The delegation highlighted the human rights conventions that had been ratified or adopted. On 1 July 2010, San Marino ratified the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime, the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking 


in Persons, Especially Women and Children, and the Protocol against the Smuggling of Migrants by Land, Sea and Air, supplementing it. On 21 July 2011, it ratified the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict (OP-CRC-AC) and the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography (OP-CRC-SC). On 23 October 2013, it acceded to the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, and, on 5 September 2014, approved Law No. 138 on ÒRegulations on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of GenocideÓ. In recent years, San Marino has ratified the following Council of Europe instruments: the Convention on the Protection of Children against Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse; the Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings; Protocol No. 15 amending the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms; and the European Charter of Local Self-Government. Furthermore, San Marino signed the Council of Europe Protocol No. 16 to the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, and the Council of Europe Convention on Preventing and Combating Violence against Women and Domestic Violence. The delegation stated that the ratification procedure was ongoing for both instruments. 

9. Regarding the question submitted by Liechtenstein, the delegation announced that, having ratified on 21 July 2011 the amendment to article 8 of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, the ratification process of the amendments to the Statute, on the crime of aggression, was expected to be completed during the current session of Parliament.  

10. The delegation also addressed the question submitted by the Netherlands on the intentions of San Marino to ratify the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime and its Additional Protocol. It stated that a study on compliance with the Convention had been completed, though, owing to the necessary adjustment of domestic legislation, the introduction of new technologies and specific training of the personnel involved, San Marino was unable to predict a time frame for accession. 

11. The delegation pointed out that progress had been made in the prevention of violence against women and gender violence, through the approval of Law No. 97 of 20 June 2008 on ÒPrevention and elimination of violence against women and gender violenceÓ, which introduced into the San Marino legal system the offences of gang violence, stalking and trafficking in human beings, and modified the offence of enslavement. The delegation also commented that the law established the Authority for Equal Opportunities as a mechanism for monitoring its implementation. The establishment of a dedicated authority allowed legislation on the protection of equal opportunity to be completed. The delegation went on to say that the Authority operates alongside the Commission for Equal Opportunities, which deals with issues related to awareness-raising and the promotion of legislative and non-legislative measures to guarantee the legal equality of citizens. 

12. On 31 May 2012, a decree was adopted to implement the above-mentioned Law. The decree also established an assistance centre for victims of violence.  

13. The delegation reported that coordination between the Health Authority and the Authority for Equal Opportunities had been established in order to collect data on violence against women and gender violence in San Marino.  

14. In addition, the delegation stated that a special study group had been established in order to identify the amendments to be made and the requirements to be met in view of the ratification of the Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women. 


15. The delegation said that the Parliament of San Marino had adopted a law that introduced amendments to the Criminal Code and the law aimed at reforming family law, by introducing the prohibition of corporal punishment in the exercise of correction or discipline powers.  

16. The delegation stated that Law No. 142 of 9 September 2014, entitled ÒLegislation relating to specific developmental disorders in schools and training facilitiesÓ, had been approved. That law underlined the importance of the role of education for the development of social integration, as strongly reiterated at the Council of Europe Standing Conference of Ministers of Education, held in Helsinki on 26 and 27 April 2014, and aimed at protecting students with specific developmental disorders and special educational needs.  

17. In the national report, the delegation cited the work carried out by the Ministries of Education and Health for the development of a framework law on disability. The proposed framework law fully incorporates the principles, definitions and content of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) and includes some instruments that are fundamental to its implementation. The delegation stated that the draft law provides for the establishment of a special commission tasked with monitoring the implementation of the principles contained in the Convention. 

18. The delegation stated that, in response to the recommendations of the Council of Europe Group of States against corruption (GRECO), Law No. 141 of 5 September 2014 introduced the ÒCode of Conduct of Public OfficialsÓ. 

19. In response to the question submitted by the Netherlands, the delegation stated that the recommendation made by the European Commission against Racism and Intolerance of the Council of Europe on the San Marino Commission for Equal Opportunities had been assessed by the Commission and that it had transmitted its opinion. In the light of this, the Government intended to work with the Commission to develop the necessary measures for the implementation of the recommendation. 

20. In reply to the question submitted by Slovenia concerning the measures adopted to improve prison detention conditions in San Marino, the delegation stated that procedures had improved in recent years. According to the delegation, San Marino had acceded in December 1989 to the European Convention for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. The delegation reported that, since then,  a delegation from the Council of Europe European Committee for the Prevention of Torture had visited San Marino four times: in March 1992, June 1999, February 2005 and January 2013. 

21. With respect to the second question submitted by Slovenia, on raising the minimum age for military recruitment to 18, the delegation stated that the age of 16 for recruitment in the case of general mobilization had been established in previous regulations, which San Marino had long planned to change. The delegation explained that the delay in the amendment of that provision was due to the fact that the measure was part of a more complex ongoing reform concerning the reorganization of the military corps and its regulations. 

22. In response to the question from Mexico on the freedom of expression in electronic format and the sanctions for improper and legally actionable conduct in the field of publishing and freedom of the media, the delegation stated that a new law sought to balance freedom of expression and protection of the dignity, integrity and privacy of the individual. The delegation explained that, under that new law, certain modes of expression of information had been regulated by introducing a code of ethics for operators and an authority that monitored any abuses or distortions. Moreover, the new law established and governed more flexible instruments for the protection of citizens and more accessible appeal procedures for individuals.  


23. The delegation reported that the law also specifically regulated the field of newspapers and online publications, by making them equal in all aspects and effects to paper publications, with the obvious differences related to the diversity of the means of expression.  


 B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review 
24. During the interactive dialogue, 35 delegations made statements. The recommendations made during the dialogue can be found in section II of the present report. 

25. Kuwait commended the efforts to promote and protect human rights and welcomed the ratification of a number of international conventions and protocols since 2010, including OP-CRC-SC; the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and two Protocols supplementing it; and the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. It noted commendable efforts that San Marino had made for the promotion of the rights of persons with disabilities and the accession to related conventions. Kuwait made a recommendation. 

26. Malaysia noted the transparent and consultative approach taken by San Marino with respect to the UPR and the progress made in the field of human rights, through its commitment to implementing the recommendations accepted during the first cycle of the UPR and the introduction of various legislative and institutional measures. In particular, Malaysia commended San Marino for ongoing and continuous steps to protect womenÕs rights and promote the role of women in the country, and measures to further integrate persons with disabilities into society, in line with its obligations under CRPD, amongst others. It noted the adoption of important laws and provisions relating to violence against women and the enforcement of measures for the protection of women, expressed appreciation for the strong belief of San Marino in the value of the family for human development and its efforts to protect the family institution, and encouraged them to continue in that regard. Malaysia made recommendations. 

27. Mexico welcomed the adoption of international instruments since the first cycle of the UPR. In particular, it noted the ratification of OP-CRC-SC, the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and two Protocols supplementing it.

It thanked San Marino for the response to its query regarding freedom of expression. Mexico made recommendations. 

28. Monaco welcomed the advances made regarding the rights of persons with disabilities, notably the steps taken to implement CRPD, as well as the extension of the advantages to adoptive and foster parents granted under Law No. 43/2014. Monaco requested further information on the functioning of the residential centre for persons with disabilities. It welcomed the ratification of OP-CRC-AC and OP-CRC-SC. Monaco made a recommendation.  

29. Montenegro commended San Marino for its commitment to the promotion and protection of human rights, expressing appreciation of its efforts to abolish the death penalty and protect the rights of women and children. While welcoming the dedication of San Marino to the UPR process, Montenegro observed that reports to several committees on the implementation of core human rights instruments were still overdue, and encouraged the Government of San Marino to make additional efforts to improve cooperation with the treaty bodies system. It noted the requests made by the Human Rights Committee concerning the introduction of a juvenile criminal justice system and asked San Marino to elaborate on the activities taken in that regard. Montenegro made recommendations. 


30. The Netherlands commended San Marino on its human rights record and efforts to ratify related instruments. In particular, it welcomed the ratification of the OP-CRC-SC and OP-CRC-AC, as well as the accession to the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. However, it noted that the independent information and concluding observations of the treaty bodies were out of date, as some country reports were still outstanding. The Netherlands made recommendations. 

31. The Philippines recognized the strong commitment of the Government of San Marino to the overall development of the country and the fulfilment of the human rights of its people and lauded the accession of San Marino to a number of international human rights conventions in the period under review, particularly its ratification of the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and two Protocols supplementing it. It asked how San Marino, as an advocate of womenÕs rights, could contribute to the strengthening of regional and international cooperation or partnerships in combating trafficking in women and girls. It noted the remarkable progress achieved by San Marino in the realization of the right to an adequate standard of living and the provision of welfare programmes and other social safety nets for citizens who became vulnerable as a result of the recent global financial instability. The Philippines made recommendations. 

32. Portugal praised the commitment of San Marino to the implementation of the recommendations accepted during the first cycle and welcomed the ratification of OP-CRC-SC and OP-CRC-AC. It noted that, although San Marino had accepted a recommendation during the first cycle of the UPR to improve timely reporting, 10 reports to the treaty bodies were still overdue. It welcomed the creation of a working group to prepare a draft law to adapt San MarinoÕs legal terminology regarding the concepts of legitimate and natural children, and encouraged efforts in that regard. Portugal made recommendations. 

33. Serbia congratulated San Marino for its dedication to human rights, democracy and the rule of law and noted San MarinoÕs efforts to align domestic legislation with international standards, as well as its pledge to comply with international treaties. It applauded San MarinoÕs advocacy work to abolish the death penalty worldwide and commended efforts to implement recommendations made by the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture. It noted that constitutional and legislative norms and ratified international treaties on human rights guaranteed equality and freedom from discrimination, and encouraged San Marino to continue its positive promotion of the principle of equality and non-discrimination, taking into account all relevant recommendations of the European Commission against racism and intolerance. Serbia made a recommendation. 

34. Sierra Leone commended San MarinoÕs efforts to promote and protect human rights in spite of the international economic crisis, which has affected the strategies and measures taken to address the right to a fair trial, as well as the death penalty, violence against women and domestic violence. It was interested to note that San Marino had been the third country to abolish the death penalty. It appreciated efforts to align domestic legislation with international human rights instruments and commended measures to ensure freedom of religion or belief. It acknowledged San MarinoÕs efforts to sign, ratify or accede to more human rights instruments since the first cycle of the UPR, but noted that further efforts were required to address racism, xenophobia and corruption. It lauded San MarinoÕs financial contribution to OHCHR in 2011 and 2013. Sierra Leone made recommendations. 

35. Singapore commended the efforts taken by San Marino to combat domestic violence, noting the role played by the Authority for Equal Opportunities in enforcing the Law on the Prevention and Elimination of Violence against Women and Gender Violence, implementing the related decree (97) to assist victims of violence and promoting public awareness on services available, including shelter for victims of domestic violence. A technical-institutional panel of experts was set up in 2012 to improve coordination among 


agencies in addressing domestic violence. Singapore noted efforts to build an inclusive society for persons with disabilities, including the drafting of a framework law on disability to strengthen implementation of CRPD, and the preparation of decrees on specific policy themes, such the elimination of architectural barriers, as well as job placements, health and social inclusion. Singapore made recommendations. 

36. Slovenia noted the implementation of the majority of recommendations accepted under the first cycle of the UPR, including ratification of OP-CRC-AC and OP-CRC-SC. It noted progress made in the field of anti-discrimination and thanked San Marino for responding to its question on steps taken to improve prison detention conditions. Following the request from the Human Rights Committee, Slovenia requested information on measures that could be taken to modify legislation (article 3 of Act No. 15 of 26 January 1990) regarding the exceptional circumstances in which all citizens aged 16 to 60 could be conscripted. Slovenia made a recommendation. 

37. Spain welcomed the delegation of San Marino and thanked it for its presentation and the replies to its advanced questions. It congratulated the country on the adoption of the Law on Provisions on Maltreatment within the Family and on Children by the Great and General Council. Spain noted the concerns expressed by the Human Rights Committee regarding the failure of San Marino to approve a new Code of Criminal Procedure. Spain made recommendations. 

38. Thailand commended the efforts made by San Marino since its first review, particularly human rights awareness-raising initiatives and the improvement of its normative framework in various areas, aimed at better integration of foreigners and vulnerable groups. It expressed appreciation of progress in the protection of childrenÕs rights, particularly regarding ratification of OP-CRC-AC and OP-CRC-SC. It expressed interest in the recent examination of a draft law on provisions against child maltreatment in the family and looked forwards to its adoption. While noting steps already taken to better protect the rights of persons with disabilities, Thailand considered that further efforts could be made to promote independent living and better integration into society. Thailand made recommendations. 

39. Ukraine noted the ratification since the last review of important international human rights mechanisms and the alignment of domestic legislation with relevant international standards. It appreciated the progress made to protect and promote the rights of its citizens, particularly regarding womenÕs rights and gender equality. It recognized the increased representation of women in the San Marino Parliament and encouraged it to take further steps in empowering women to end the underrepresentation of women in the Government, particularly in ministerial positions. Ukraine welcomed efforts regarding freedom of expression, particularly the initiation of procedures on a new draft law on publishing and the profession of media operators, and expressed hope that it would be swiftly adopted and compliant with corresponding international standards. 

40. The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland welcomed San MarinoÕs firm commitment to the promotion and protection of human rights. It commended San Marino for its ongoing efforts to reflect international human rights standards in domestic legislation. The United Kingdom made recommendations. 

41. The United States of America commended San MarinoÕs exemplary human rights record, longstanding commitment to democracy and the promotion and protection of human rights. While recognizing that labour standards were generally well enforced, it expressed concern that some employers did not consistently abide by safety regulations, including limitations on working hours and the use of personal safety devices, particularly in the informal labour market. It noted that the Ministry for Territory and Environment had not 


fully implemented a law that mandated easier access to public buildings for persons with disabilities, and that many buildings remained inaccessible. It made recommendations.  

42. Uruguay noted San MarinoÕs ratification of OP-CRC-AC and OP-CRC-SC, and its accession to regional human rights instruments. It noted the draft law to prohibit the corporal punishment of children in all settings, including at home and in day care, and hoped that it would be discussed fruitfully by the Parliament in order to meet San MarinoÕs commitments pursuant to the first cycle of the UPR. It noted San MarinoÕs efforts to comply with its international obligations, in particular regular reporting to treaty bodies. It encouraged San Marino to continue those efforts and its cooperation with OHCHR. It welcomed that San Marino was considering acceding to the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (OP-ICESCR). Uruguay made recommendations.  

43. The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela emphasized San MarinoÕs political commitment to implementing recommendations accepted during the first cycle of the UPR, despite the serious international economic crisis. It noted San MarinoÕs adherence to international instruments, including the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and two Protocols supplementing it, the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, OP-CRC-SC and OP-CRC-AC. It commended progress made in the legal sphere to promote equality of all people before the law and protect the rights and freedoms of the population and acknowledged the policies to protect womenÕs rights and promote their participation in society through the adoption of important legal provisions and measures relating to the protection of women from violence. It made a recommendation. 

44. Algeria congratulated San Marino on the ratification of OP-CRC-AC and OP-CRC-SC; as well as the adoption of legal provisions relating to violence against women and the promulgation of texts to improve the effectiveness of the legal system, particularly in the area of criminal law. It welcomed the measures taken to consolidate the protection of the family and its solidarity. Algeria made recommendations. 

45. Argentina welcomed the delegation of San Marino. It congratulated San Marino for acceding to the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. Argentina made recommendations. 

46. Australia, commending San MarinoÕs exemplary human rights record, noted that its human rights framework valued the integrity of the person, afforded a high degree of political participation and enforced civil liberties. Despite the fact that the Declaration on the CitizensÕ Rights and Fundamental Principles of San Marino Constitutional Order prohibited discrimination on all grounds, it was concerned that same-sex couples still encountered discrimination in some basic rights, including residency and inheritance. It commended efforts to protect the rights of persons with disabilities in many areas, particularly employment, education, health care and other state services. Australia made recommendations. 

47. Brazil welcomed the ratification of OP-CRC-AC, OP-CRC-SC and the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, and the enactment of legislation on maltreatment within the family and on children. It maintained that it was important to increase awareness of the importance of combating racism, racial discrimination and xenophobia, through the effective implementation of Law No. 66 on provisions against racial, ethnic and religious discrimination. Noting that Decree No. 60/2012 established various forms of assistance to women who were victims of violence, Brazil asked what specific measures had been taken to prevent gender-based and domestic violence. Brazil made recommendations. 


48. Burkina Faso noted San MarinoÕs commitment to cooperate with human rights mechanisms, including its standing invitation to the special procedures of the Human Rights Council. It welcomed efforts to abolish the death penalty, combat transnational organized crime, legalize the residence status of foreign nationals and support workers who were victims of the economic crisis. It commended the ratification of various human rights instruments, notably OP-CRC-AC and OP-CRC-SC, and regional instruments, by acceding to instruments containing complaint mechanisms and enabling individuals to seek reparation. It welcomed the adoption of legislation to protect female victims of violence, including domestic violence, and actions in favour of children and persons with disabilities. It encouraged the establishment of the National Observatory on the Family, increased efforts to promote human rights in its educational system and improved reporting to treaty bodies. 

49. Canada asked San Marino to provide up-to-date information regarding steps to establish an independent ombudsman for the protection and promotion of human rights, in accordance with the principles relating to the status of national institutions (Paris Principles). It noted that San Marino had ratified OP-CRC-AC and OP-CRC-SC, and had welcomed the contribution that those instruments made to the protection of the rights of children. Canada made recommendations. 

50. Costa Rica thanked San Marino for the presentation of its national report and congratulated the progress made in the promotion and protection of human rights. It noted that San Marino had ratified several international instruments and had been the first State party to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court to ratify the amendment to article 8 of that Statute. It welcomed the adoption of measures to prohibit the corporal punishment of children and those that had raised the minimum age of criminal responsibility. Costa Rica made recommendations. 

51. C™te dÕIvoire said that the national report indicated the constant commitment of the Government of San Marino to the promotion and protection of human rights, through the adoption of various measures and policies for the promotion of equality for all, such as those aimed at combating discrimination; protecting women, children, elderly persons and persons with disabilities; combating domestic violence; and strengthening the judicial, political and social systems. Those measures demonstrated the importance that San Marino placed on international obligations and on the protection of fundamental freedoms. It encouraged San Marino to continue to cooperate with international human rights mechanisms. C™te dÕIvoire made recommendations. 

52. Estonia noted San MarinoÕs accession to most core international human rights instruments and its standing invitation to the special procedures of the Human Rights Council. However, it raised concern at the lack of reporting to the treaty bodies and hoped that San Marino would make positive steps in that regard. It commended the ratification of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide; the United Nations Convention on Transnational Organized Crime, the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children supplementing it, OP-CRC-SC and OP-CRC-AC. In that regard, it called upon San Marino to review the law on extraordinary military conscription and withdraw the relevant clauses of that law to bring it into compliance with OP-CRC-AC. The protection of womenÕs rights and their participation in society was a priority and should continue. There was a need for a freedom of information law in accordance with international standards. Estonia made recommendations. 

53. France welcomed the delegation from San Marino. It welcomed the commitment shown by San Marino in favour of human rights, and its accession to various international human rights instruments since its review under the first cycle of the UPR. France made recommendations. 


54. Germany thanked San Marino for its national report and welcomed the progress made by the country since the first cycle of the UPR, for example, regarding its human rights legislation. It commended San MarinoÕs cooperation with civil society, OHCHR, the special procedures of the Human Rights Council and United Nations treaty bodies. Germany made recommendations. 

55. Ghana welcomed the delegation of San Marino and applauded the countryÕs dedication to the UPR process. Ghana made recommendations. 

56. The Holy See welcomed steps taken since the first cycle of the UPR to promote and protect human rights and strengthen legislation and on the administration of justice in line with international instruments. It commended the continued protection of the institution of the family as a union based on a stable relationship between a man and a woman, and the related legislation that extended the right of a parent to be absent from the workplace when his or her child was ill or to assist family members who required special assistance, including owing to disability or serious age-related disease. It made recommendations. 

57. Indonesia applauded the priority given to the protection of womenÕs rights in national policy and the adoption and effective implementation of Law No. 97/2008 on the prevention and elimination of violence against women and gender violence. The establishment of a national human rights institution in line with the Paris Principles would further support San MarinoÕs efforts to combat violence against women, as well as its efforts in other areas. Indonesia noted that San Marino had ratified several international human rights instruments. The International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families (ICRMW) would be particularly relevant, as one third of San MarinoÕs population lived abroad. Indonesia made recommendations. 

58. Ireland commended San Marino for extending a standing invitation to the special procedures of the Human Rights Council. However, it noted that a significant number of reports to the treaty bodies were overdue. It welcomed San MarinoÕs ratification of OP-CRC-AC and OP-CRC-SC. Ireland made recommendations. 

59. Italy commended San Marino for its commitment to cooperating with international human rights mechanisms, and for extending a standing invitation to the special procedures of the Human Rights Council. It noted the difficulties faced by San Marino in fulfilling its reporting obligations, and the measures it had taken to end the backlog. It encouraged San Marino to consider best practices and expedite the drafting of reports under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. It asked for information about the function, lessons learned and best practices of the panel created to coordinate measures to prevent and combat violence against women. It asked whether San Marino would consider the establishment of a formal procedure for processing asylum requests. Italy made a recommendation. 

60. San Marino thanked all the delegations for their interesting and valuable recommendations. 

61. As regards the treatment of asylum applications, the Minister for Foreign Affairs informed the delegations that it was not foreseen to introduce a relevant procedure, given the very low number of applications received in recent years, often submitted by persons from countries that upheld high human rights standards. Establishing a procedure to determine refugee status would prove problematic owing to the lack of border control between Italy and San Marino. 

62. In the case of foreigners who were unable to return to their home countries, he said that the Government of San Marino may issue an extraordinary stay permit for humanitarian and social protection reasons issued on a case-by-case basis. Beneficiaries 


would then be entitled to temporary medical and financial assistance provided by the Social Welfare Institute. 

63. With respect to questions related to discrimination, including on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity, and on the need to protect single-parent and non-conventional families, he said that all people were equal before the law and all forms of discrimination were rejected under the Declaration of CitizensÕ Rights. All sectors of the public administration were also abiding by that principle. Such prohibition was reinforced by Law No. 66/2008, which punished anyone who incites or commits any act of discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. The Law considered it an aggravating circumstance. 

64. Despite the lack of a national plan against discrimination, he said that San Marino had participated in international campaigns and had carried out national initiatives to raise awareness in that field. 

65. The Minister said that great importance had been attached to the role played by the Authority and the Commission for Equal Opportunities, which have jointly promoted actions to encourage the participation of all citizens in the political, social and economic life according to the principle of legal equality. 

66. In that regard, he said that school played a major role. Respect for diversity was discussed and promoted in all school grades, thus favouring integration, learning about different cultures, understanding and tolerance. The fight against discrimination was a practical experience in school, which contributed effectively to inclusion. All children residing in San Marino, including on a temporary basis, were provided with a free education. All children with disabilities, including those with severe disabilities, had access to education, including through the support of professionals and personalized didactical tools. 

67. Regarding the question of single-parent and non-conventional families, he said that, in San Marino, there had been a growing number of unmarried cohabiting couples. Also, that category of persons was recognized and protected by San Marino family law. Indeed, children born from those relationships enjoyed the same rights as those of children born in wedlock. In that regard, attention was also brought to single-parent families who, on account of their inherent characteristics, required stronger protection. Due consideration had also been given to single-parent families by allowing single people to adopt children. 

68. The Minister said that a national debate, encouraged by civil society, was ongoing about same-sex unions. Parliament had recently addressed the issue and had decided not to consider same-sex unions on an equal footing to traditional households. Cohabitation between persons of the same sex was recognized if they are entitled to live in the territory, but their rights and duties were regulated by private law. 

69. As for human rights education, he said that San Marino was committed to the promotion of human rights in education by implementing relevant projects, including training for teachers and the involvement of families. 

70. He said that education on human rights and the protection and respect for differences followed an interdisciplinary approach and was aimed at promoting the integration of values in all contexts to combat racism and intolerance.  

71. As regards the question on the facility for persons with disabilities, ÒIl Colore del GranoÓ, it was explained that the centre hosted persons with various types of disabilities and contributed to their education, rehabilitation and social inclusion by providing assistance, care and treatment, including in support of their families. 


72. With reference to international instruments, San Marino recognized the importance of treaties that contain individual complaint mechanisms and was committed to addressing reporting delays and to acceding to OP-ICESCR, the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on a communications procedure, and to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) Convention against Discrimination in Education.

Introduction 
1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, established in accordance with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its sixteenth session from 22 April to 3 May 2013. The review of Tuvalu was held at the 6th meeting on 24 April 2013. The delegation of Tuvalu was headed by Eselealofa Apinelu, Attorney General. At its 10th meeting held on 26 April 2013, the Working Group adopted the report on Tuvalu. 
2. On 14 January 2013, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Tuvalu: Estonia, Mauritania and the Republic of Korea. 
3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1 and paragraph 5 of the annex to resolution 16/21, the following documents were issued for the review of Tuvalu: 
 (a) A national report submitted/written presentation made in accordance with paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/16/TUV/1 and Corr.1);  
 (b) A compilation prepared by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) (A/HRC/WG.6/16/TUV/2); 
 (c) A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) (A/HRC/WG.6/16/TUV/3).  
4. A list of questions prepared in advance by Liechtenstein, Mexico, Montenegro, the Netherlands, Slovenia, Spain and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland was transmitted to Tuvalu through the troika. These questions are available on the extranet of the universal periodic review (UPR). 
 I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
 A. Presentation by the State under review 
5. At the 6th meeting, on 24 April 2013, Ms. Apinelu, Attorney General, presented the national report and made an opening statement. She affirmed the commitment of Tuvalu to UPR and expressed appreciation to those who had provided support in the preparation of the State report. 
6. The Head of the Delegation started her intervention by referring to the specific vulnerabilities that Tuvalu, as a small island State, had to face, namely the threat of the adverse impacts of climate change and sea-level rise, as well as the lack of capacity. The impact of globalization was overwhelming and the global financial crisis, together with the physical and social character of the country, had seriously undermined the countryÕs ability to provide essential services to its people. The continuing loss of vital land, destruction of food crops and contamination of the ground-water supply by seawater intrusion were everyday challenges that affected the competing interests and priority needs of the Government and that seriously undermined the capacity of Tuvalu to protect fundamental human rights and to particularly fully implement economic, social and cultural rights. 
7. The cultural traditions of Tuvalu and its community interests preserved harmony and peace in the country and influenced the behaviour of society and the management of the island community. To that extent, governance was assured through the falekaupule, the traditional house of the island chiefs and elders. 
8. Despite the above-mentioned situations, Tuvalu expressed its commitment to protect human rights and to meet its obligations on human rights, while noting that many commitments were dependent on the availability of financial and technical resources. In that regard, the advantages of the UPR process were welcomed, particularly the fact that it allowed Tuvalu to take stock of the human rights protection and permitted the Government to inform the international community of its human rights situation and to engage with other countries regarding the improvement of human rights. 
9. With the aim of answering the advance questions received, the Head of the Delegation explained that, despite the fact that Tuvalu had not fully implemented all the supported recommendations of the last review, it had addressed human rights matters of significant relevance for the country, by mainly using the Te Kakeega II (National Strategic Development Plan). Some of the key national priorities identified in the National Strategic Development Plan were: education, health, establishment of the OmbudsmanÕs Commission, gender-equality promotion, expansion of womenÕs role in development, youthsÕ participation in sports, promotion of traditional knowledge and culture, local governance and community development, revision of labour-related legislation, access to safe drinking water, housing availability and mitigation of the impacts on agriculture of climate change. 
10. She also highlighted some progresses made related to TuvaluÕs human rights commitments, such as the reporting to the Committee on the Rights of the Child and the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women; the support of the visit of the Special Rapporteur on the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation; the support of the ratification of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities; the accession to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court; the inclusion of gender in government planning; and the visibility given to climate change issues. 
11. Tuvalu noted, however, several challenges and constraints in the implementation of recommendations and the overall human rights commitments, mainly the funding constraints, resource availability and opportunity, which denied the outer islands the opportunity to participate actively. The impacts of climate change and sea-level rise; the lack of internal capacity, financial support, human resources and understanding of the United Nations human rights conventions, were likewise recognized as constraints on implementing the UPR recommendations. 
12. Tuvalu mentioned that its plans for implementing the recommendations of the Special Rapporteur on the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation would be finalized upon receiving the final report from the Special Rapporteur. However, the Government was working to ensure a priority to access to safe drinking water and sanitation facilities. 
13. Tuvalu reported that the Government was considering supporting the ratification of core human rights treaties but discussions were ongoing given the countryÕs capacity constraints and the responsibility attached to the implementation of such treaties. 
14. Likewise, regarding the questions received on legislative compliance, the Government was seeking financial and technical assistance from the international community. In that regard, with the assistance of the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat, Tuvalu was considering facilitating a legislative compliance review of national laws and a cost benefit analysis before ratifying specific treaties. The Government had already endorsed accession to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, however. 
15. On womenÕs rights and traditional practices, domestic violence was the main form of violence against women in Tuvalu. The CEDAW National Taskforce was giving more attention to this issue and the Family Protection and Domestic Violence Bill was awaiting community consultations in all islands before resubmission to Cabinet for consulting in 
Parliament. Furthermore, in 2009 the Parliament passed the Police Powers and Duties Act, which made domestic violence a criminal offence, recognized that domestic violence was not a private issue and specifically mandated the Police to respond to domestic violence. 
16. While acknowledging the inconsistency of the countryÕs domestic laws and cultural and traditional practices on the treatment of womenÕs rights, the Department of Women Affairs aimed to use cultural realities to challenge harmful cultural practices. Furthermore, the Department of Women had increased the advocacy and lobbying on temporary special measures, especially in decision-making at the local and national level, and was also lobbying to support the amendment of the Constitution to prohibit sex and gender discrimination. 
17. The Head of the Delegation expressed that people with different sexual orientation did not suffer social discrimination but the question of legal protection in the law was controversial and would need to be carefully considered. Tuvalu was open to discussion. 
18. Tuvalu noted that consultations were ongoing with a view to amending the Constitution once there was wider understanding and acceptance of gender equality. 
19. The Government was progressively realizing the recommendation to amend the legislation to include a safeguard against statelessness. 
20. Tuvalu reiterated its commitment to protect the human rights of its people, for which purpose it requested relevant assistance in its effort to fulfil its human rights obligations. 
 B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review 
21. During the interactive dialogue, 38 delegations made statements. Recommendations made during the dialogue can be found in chapter II of the present report.  
22. Maldives acknowledged significant developments since 2008 and appreciated efforts to address violence against women and the formulation of the Family Protection and Domestic Violence Bill. It recognized the need for international technical assistance and financial support to fully realize its first-cycle recommendations, as well as capacity-building and awareness-raising. It acknowledged water scarcity and urged the consideration of the report from the Special Rapporteur on the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation as the basis for advancement. Maldives made recommendations. 
23. Mexico acknowledged the strengthening of human rights despite the challenges faced by Tuvalu. It welcomed cooperation with special procedures and the visit from Special Rapporteur on the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation. It expressed a hope to see a law on water adopted as soon as possible. It welcomed the report submitted on the Convention on the Rights of the Child. It encouraged the ongoing work to include prohibition of discrimination based on sex and gender in the Constitution. Mexico made recommendations. 
24. Montenegro acknowledged the limited capacities of Tuvalu and encouraged the United Nations to provide specific assistance for the ratification of more human rights treaties. It recognized the importance of a plan of action as recommended by the Special Rapporteur on the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation. It expressed concern over disadvantaged position of women in some fields. It requested information on steps to amend the Constitution and to incorporate principles of equality and prohibition of sex- and gender-based discrimination into legislation. Montenegro made recommendations. 
25. Morocco recognized the challenges to the full realization of social, economic and cultural rights faced by Tuvalu, and commended its efforts to harmonize domestic 
legislation with international human rights instruments and implement institutional mechanisms to guarantee human rights. Morocco made recommendations. 
26. Canada indicated that, in 2008, in response to interventions on freedom of religion or belief and freedom of expression relating to discrimination against individuals of certain beliefs that stemmed from traditional and customary practices, Tuvalu had recognized that there existed a discrepancy between the law and certain traditional practices and expressed its commitment to address that matter. Canada requested information on the status of current laws and concrete steps taken thereon. It welcomed the formulation of a Family Protection Bill and the announcement of the launching of community consultations. Canada made recommendations. 
27. New Zealand commended the commitment of Tuvalu to improve the human rights protection, including addressing domestic violence, although more remained to be done. New Zealand requested information on the steps taken to ensure a mechanism, such as an Ombudsman, to investigate allegations of human rights violations. Noting resource constraints and geographic challenges, it commended the countryÕs efforts in financial governance. It noted that health and education services should be prioritized. New Zealand made a recommendation. 
28. Nicaragua recognized that Tuvalu had limited national resources and underscored the cooperation shown in hosting the Special Rapporteur on the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation. It also expressed hope for the creation of a framework for cooperation, bearing in mind the harmful consequences of climate change. It recognized efforts to achieve participation by and empowerment of women. It encouraged continued efforts to improve equality between men and women. Nicaragua made a recommendation. 
29. Nigeria commended progress in promoting and protecting human rights and in ensuring that human rights standards were included in the domestic legislation. It noted the efforts of Tuvalu to empower women through its National WomenÕs Policy and youth through its National Youth Policy. Nigeria made recommendations. 
30. Philippines noted the progress of Tuvalu in building the normative framework and institutions on human rights and commended the enactment of laws and the establishment of government offices such as the PeopleÕs Lawyers Office and the Department of WomenÕs Affairs. It welcomed the ratification of core human rights instruments. It commended the work on the National Strategic Plan key priorities. It recognized the countryÕs constraints and supported the appeal to the international community for technical assistance. It made a recommendation. 
31. Senegal noted the integration of international human rights standards into domestic legislation. It welcomed the establishment of a special task force to eliminate violence against women. Senegal recognized the challenges faced and endorsed the countryÕs call for technical assistance. It made a recommendation. 
32. Singapore noted that, despite challenges, Tuvalu had made progress in promoting and protecting human rights. It commended steps taken to promote womenÕs rights and acknowledged the National WomenÕs Policy and the Family Protection and Domestic Violence Bill. Singapore noted the impact of the climate change on peopleÕs access to food, safe drinking water, adequate housing and arable land. It recognized the preparation of a comprehensive National Adaptation Programme of Action and noted the active engagement of international organizations to support its implementation. Singapore made recommendations. 
33. The Head of Delegation thanked the distinguished delegates for all the comments and welcomed the recommendations provided as a way to improve human rights in Tuvalu. 
She stated that Tuvalu would require assistance in order to implement or carry forward these recommendations. 
34. She referred that the report from the Special Rapporteur on the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation was most helpful to the country and stated her belief that it would form a very good basis for the Government to use and try to fulfil its obligations with regard to the matter. 
35. Concerning protection of women and children and the Family Protection and Domestic Violence Bill, the Head of the Delegation reported that consultations with outer islands to fully explain the content of the bill to the people and receive their comments were hindered by transportation problems. However, she assured that the matter remained a priority for the Office of the Attorney General and the Office of the Prime Minister. 
36. With regard to the OmbudsmanÕs Commission to specifically address human rights issues, the Government had implemented the establishment of the OmbudsmanÕs Commission under the Leadership Code to look into breaches of that code with leadersÕ role in decision-making. 
37. In relation to other human rights instruments to which Tuvalu was required to sign up, all human rights issues were beneficial to the country but it was just a matter of how Tuvalu could actively engage and fulfil those commitments given its financial constraints and human resources limitations, which obliged Tuvalu to set priorities as to what could actually be done in any given year and within current capabilities. 
38. WomenÕs protection was a priority and, in almost every official or non-official meeting or gathering, there was an opportunity for womenÕs organizations to highlight their aims and visions and to seek support from the community in furthering the equality issue. However, the process of getting the proposed amendments to the Constitution aimed at ensuring a provision on equal treatment on the basis of sex was still under consultation as there was not yet clear support from all the islands. Nevertheless, the Department of WomenÕs Affairs was actively engaged in consulting and trying to ensure that support was received for those matters. 
39. Slovakia recognized the vulnerability of Tuvalu to the impacts of climate change. It commended the Education for Life programme providing free and universal primary education and the achievement of high literacy rates. It acknowledged the development of the Draft Water Act, the Sustainable and Integrated Water and Sanitation policy, the establishment of the Department of WomenÕs Affairs and the inclusion of women and gender development in the 2005-2015 National Strategic Development Plan. Slovakia made recommendations.  
40. Slovenia noted progress in the human rights commitments and obligations of Tuvalu and in the inclusion of human rights standards in domestic legislation. It noted concern at violence against women, including domestic violence, from the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women. It acknowledged the ratification of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) and the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC). It welcomed the countryÕs agreement to the 2012 visit from the Special Rapporteur on the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation. Slovenia made recommendations. 
41. Spain welcomed the efforts of Tuvalu to fulfil its international obligations and underscored the visit from the Special Rapporteur on the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation. It mentioned the GovernmentÕs decision to reflect on the ratification of core human rights instruments and expressed hope that such reflection would be positive. It noted the priorities identified in the Second National Strategic Development Plan, including gender equality. Spain made recommendations. 
42. Thailand welcomed legislation adopted to promote and protect human rights. It acknowledged progress in ensuring gender equality and womenÕs basic rights but remained concerned about reports of domestic violence and stereotyping regarding womenÕs role in society. It appreciated the submission of the report to the Committee on the Rights of the Child and the establishment of a school for children with special needs. It supported child rights as a top national agenda. Thailand recognized the constraints and challenges faced by Tuvalu and encouraged the international community and OHCHR to provide assistance and capacity-building. It made recommendations. 
43. Trinidad and Tobago noted the key national human rights priorities of Tuvalu that included the promotion of gender equality and the provision of safe drinking water.  It commended the work of the Department of Women in collaboration with the United Nations Development Programme. It acknowledged the climate-change challenges faced and commended the National Adaptation Programme of Action to address such issues. It welcomed the visit by the Special Rapporteur on the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation to examine the water and sanitation situation in Tuvalu. It made recommendations. 
44. Turkey acknowledged positive steps taken to implement the countryÕs commitment to human rights. It recognized constraints and invited regional and international development partners to provide technical and financial assistance. Turkey expressed confidence in the successful implementation of the National Strategic Development Plan and its prioritization of issues such as the OmbudsmanÕs Commission, the promotion of gender equality and the role of women in development. It underscored the importance of having a national human rights institution. Turkey made recommendations. 
45. The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland recognized the challenges faced by Tuvalu, particularly climate change, and acknowledged the level of consultation with civil society. It noted the ratification of just two international human rights treaties and encouraged the signature and ratification of other human rights treaties. It urged steps to address water and sanitation problems. It emphasized the importance of the right to social security and an adequate standard of living. It made recommendations. 
46. The United States of America commended Tuvalu for its 2010 elections. It noted and encouraged the participation in the subregional audit support programme. It welcomed the increased school attendance by girls and the increased womenÕs participation in several areas. It expressed condolences at the loss of the Finance Minister and noted the need for a by-election. It raised concern over the application of and limitations in the Religious Organizations Restriction Act as well as over the illegality of sexual relations between males. It strongly supported decriminalizing consensual sexual relations between adults. It made recommendations. 
47. Uruguay expressed appreciation for the countryÕs efforts and commitment to the UPR process. It highlighted the legislative advances and institutional reforms made, which had helped towards fulfilling some of the previous UPR recommendations, despite the constraints and challenges facing Tuvalu. Uruguay made recommendations. 
48. Concerning the efforts of Tuvalu to ratify core human rights treaties, the Head of the Delegation reiterated that assistance had been requested from the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat to carry out a legislative review of the laws. From having ratified two human rights treaties, Tuvalu had realized of the obligations that came with signing up to international conventions. Tuvalu supported the idea of ratifying all core human rights treaties but it must make sure that it was in a position to fulfil what it was bound to do once an international convention was ratified. 
49. Tuvalu reiterated its commitment with the special procedures and specifically acknowledged the assistance that Tuvalu could get from the report of the Special Rapporteur on the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation. 
50. With reference to the country laws and traditional practices, which seemed to be in conflict with international law, that was a matter which continued consultations between the relevant authorities and the traditional assemblies on each island. 
51. The Religious Organizations Restrictions Act was the GovernmentÕs first attempt to facilitate dialogue between people who wanted to exercise freedom of religion and the countryÕs traditional practices. It was the first law forbidding island communities from stopping anyone from sharing religious beliefs. The starting point of the law was to allow people to come in and explain and share their religious beliefs. Consultations were continuing, not just on religion but also on womenÕs issues, between traditional leaders, decision makers, relevant government authorities, non-governmental organizations and civil society. 
52. Viet Nam noted the remarkable progress made by Tuvalu since its first UPR in ensuring that human rights were included in national legislation. It highlighted the drafting and implementation of several important acts, such as on Constitutional amendment, the Leadership Code, police powers and duties, public enterprises and environmental protection. As a developing country, Viet Nam shared the constraints and challenges faced by Tuvalu in implementing its human rights obligations. It called upon the international community to support Tuvalu. It made recommendations. 
53. Algeria, while acknowledging the challenges facing Tuvalu, noted the positive developments since its previous review, particularly the inclusion of international human rights standards into national legislation; measures in favour of persons with disabilities; and the adoption of the National WomenÕs Policy, the draft National Youth Policy and the Family Protection and Domestic Violence Bill. It echoed the request for technical and financial assistance to implement the countryÕs national priorities. Algeria made recommendations. 
54. Australia commended the Police Service Act and the Police Powers and Duties Act and noted that changes to police legislation aligned with the International Covenants on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and on Economic, Cultural and Social Rights (ICESCR). It was concerned about the delay in setting a date for a by-election in the electorate of Nukufetau and urged elections to be held to ensure representation of all Tuvaluans in Parliament. Australia acknowledged progress on gender equality and welcomed the engagement with the International Criminal Court. Australia made recommendations. 
55. Azerbaijan congratulated the cooperation of Tuvalu with United Nations mechanisms and welcomed its readiness to accede to the core international human rights treaties. It noted efforts to ensure gender mainstreaming and womenÕs empowerment and to combat domestic violence, as well as the adoption of the Police Powers and Duties Act. It was aware of the constraints faced by Tuvalu in the promotion and protection of human rights and the negative impact of climate change, and highlighted the need for support on the implementation of its human rights obligations. Azerbaijan made recommendations. 
56. Brazil expressed appreciation for TuvaluÕs commitment to the establishment of a national human rights institution; its openness to cooperation with its international partners in the sphere of human rights; its achievements in awareness-raising; and the impressive work carried out by the PeopleÕs Lawyers Office in the field of access to justice. All such advances were a token of the unswerving commitment of Tuvalu to human rights, despite the social, economic and environmental challenges faced. Brazil made recommendations. 
57. The Netherlands welcomed the National WomenÕs Policy, which was a positive step towards promoting gender equality and womenÕs participation in the public sector. The Netherlands would continue to monitor its implementation, as the position of women was still vulnerable. It made recommendations. 
58. Chile recognized the countryÕs difficulties in implementing the recommendations of 2008 and the financial and human resource constraints. It acknowledged the commitment of Tuvalu to UPR and the special procedures; the measures adopted to ensure free and universal primary education for children and youth; the strengthening of the Attorney GeneralÕs Office, the PeopleÕs Lawyers Office and the police; and the implementation of national youth and womenÕs policies. It encouraged Tuvalu to intensify efforts to ratify the various outstanding international human rights instruments. Chile made recommendations. 
59. Costa Rica echoed the appeal of Tuvalu for technical and economic assistance. It acknowledged efforts to incorporate human rights standards into domestic legislation; the significant progress in the field of womenÕs rights and empowerment at all levels of society; the legislative measures to combat human trafficking, especially of children; and the drafting of national youth policies. It urged Tuvalu to design a national plan or policy for children, recognizing the benefits of social investment in childhood. It highlighted the serious impact of climate change on the enjoyment of human rights. It made recommendations. 
60. Cuba praised the steps taken by Tuvalu to promote and protect the rights of persons with disabilities and persons living with HIV/AIDS; the improvement of peopleÕs access to health services; and the increased awareness of human rights in the context of domestic violence. It welcomed several initiatives to combat HIV/AIDS and the discrimination of people living with HIV/AIDS. It asked Tuvalu about possible forms of international cooperation which could be entered into to ensure that its people fully enjoyed their human rights, particularly the rights to education and health. 
61. Estonia noted with appreciation the inclusion of human rights standards in domestic legislation and progress in the implementation of several recommendations. It commended Tuvalu on prioritizing gender equality and promoting the role of women in its National Strategic Development Plan. Estonia urged Tuvalu to amend legislation to bring it into line with CEDAW and to raise awareness about womenÕs rights and gender equality in society. It encouraged Tuvalu to show a strong commitment to the rule of law by ratifying and aligning its legislation with the Rome Statute and acceding to the Agreement on the Privileges and Immunities of the International Criminal Court. Estonia made recommendations. 
62. With reference to the by-election question, the Head of the Delegation reported that it was a matter before the High Court, which would probably instruct as to when the by-election will be carried out. 
63. The Attorney General reiterated that women took priority in Tuvalu and that there were ongoing consultations on that matter. However, several cultural practices stopped women from doing certain things and it would probably take time for women to break away from the bonds of cultural practices. She stated that there were no laws which prevented women from having equal access to employment. 
64. On the ratification of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, it was reiterated that the Cabinet had already endorsed accession thereto and that the Optional Protocol was under consideration. 
65. The Director of Education stated that the system was trying to promote education, particularly early childhood education, which was one of the priorities of the National Strategic Development Plan. 
66. On the area of corporal punishment, she noted the recent review of the Education Act with the aim of integrating human rights concerns. She explained that corporal punishment was legal and allowed, but only by the head teachers. Tuvalu was working to combat that and discussions had been conducted on the issue. Tuvalu requested support from the international community to improve that area. 
67. Concerning corporal punishment of children in a domestic context, the delegate from the Crown Counsel reported about a workshop conducted by the Red Cross society to formulate a policy for the child protection, which covered protection of children, inter alia, from physical, emotional, sexual and financial abuse. He expressed hope that with additional assistance the policy would come into effect soon. He also called for amendments to the Education Act to prohibit corporal punishment. 
68. France welcomed the willingness of Tuvalu to defend human rights, despite the economic and financial constraints and environmental challenges it faced. It particularly welcomed the action taken by Tuvalu to combat poverty and to promote quasi-universal access to health services and education. France made recommendations. 
69. Germany welcomed the visit of the Special Rapporteur on the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation. Referring to the Constitution Amendment Act, Germany asked Tuvalu how the Government intended to guarantee the right of every person to freedom of religion or belief in the application of the act. It welcomed recent steps to strengthen the legal and social status of women, but was concerned that neither the Constitution nor other legislation embodied the principle of gender equality, nor contained a definition of discrimination against women. Germany made recommendations. 
70. Guatemala welcomed the development of policies to promote human rights, particularly the National WomenÕs Policy, the National Youth Policy, the Inclusive Education Policy and the National Strategic Development Plan. It shared the concerns of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women at the lack of public awareness of womenÕs rights and gender equality; at womenÕs lack of awareness of their rights; and at the paternal transmission of land ownership. While welcoming improvements on the matter, it urged Tuvalu to continue efforts to promote gender equality throughout the country. Guatemala made recommendations. 
71. Hungary took note of the cooperation with OHCHR and the expertise extended by CEDAW and the Special Rapporteur on the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation. It recognized efforts to eliminate gender inequalities but encouraged the country to include gender as a prohibited ground for discrimination in the Constitution. Hungary believed that free and universal primary education should be accessible to both urban and rural areas and gender equality should be incorporated into the higher education levels. It was concerned that corporal punishment of children was still lawful in schools. It noted the Inclusive Education Policy and encouraged increased participation of persons with disabilities in formal decision levels. Hungary made recommendations. 
72. Indonesia welcomed the Second National Strategic Development Plan and its mid-term review, whose key national priorities demonstrated the commitment of Tuvalu to human rights. It agreed with the importance of technical and financial assistance from regional and international development partners in implementing those priorities. It commended measures adopted to raise public awareness of the rights of vulnerable groups, including women and persons with disabilities. It welcomed the adoption of the Police Powers and Duties Act, which would help to eradicate domestic violence. Indonesia made recommendations. 
73. Ireland, noting the adverse impact of sea-level rise on food security, water and health on the people of Tuvalu, welcomed the GovernmentÕs position on the need for the international community to address the human rights dimensions of climate change. Ireland 
urged Tuvalu to ensure that the provisions of international human rights treaties were fully implemented in policy and practice. On access to justice issues, it urged Tuvalu to ensure that the PeopleÕs Lawyers Office was given the necessary human and financial resources to operate effectively in all the islands. Ireland made recommendations. 
74. Italy welcomed efforts deployed by Tuvalu to comply with international human rights standards and to implement CRC and CEDAW. Italy noted the internal debate on possible accession to other core international human rights instruments. It noted reports indicating that action deployed to protect womenÕs rights still had limited impact. Italy made recommendations. 
75. Malaysia noted the progress made since the first UPR of Tuvalu, particularly on the inclusion of human rights standards in domestic legislation. It acknowledged that remaining challenges were hindering the full enjoyment of human rights and hoped that the international community would heed the countryÕs call for technical and financial assistance in fulfilling its human rights obligations. It welcomed ongoing efforts in gender mainstreaming and observed that progress had been made in youth development, inclusive education and persons with disabilities. Malaysia made recommendations. 
76. The Head of the Delegation, in response to the question on repealing the new laws adopted to address the issues in relation to freedom of religion and its cultural practices, said that there were ongoing consultations between the islands. The approach of Tuvalu was to facilitate dialogue between religious organizations and the different islands. 
77. With regard to the PeopleÕs Lawyers Office, it was noted that Tuvalu needed assistance in that area. Meetings had taken place to discuss having a pool of available lawyers but the PeopleÕs Lawyers Office currently had only one lawyer. 
78. Lastly, concerning the call for Tuvalu to ratify the core human rights treaties, as had been stated previously, a legislative review was currently being carried out in order to give the Government and people of Tuvalu an understanding of the obligations before ratifying international conventions. 
79. The Head of the Delegation took the opportunity to thank the Tuvaluan delegation for assisting in this presentation as well as all the countries for their comments and recommendations.  
80.

 I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
 A. Presentation by the State under review 
5. The delegation stated that the first universal periodic review of Kazakhstan provided an opportunity for the Government to assess its achievements and challenges in the promotion and protection of human rights.  

6. The national report of the second review, which provided information on the implementation of the recommendations of the first review, was subject to broad discussions with representatives of civil society and independent experts, before its submission to the Human Rights Council. The advisory body, entitled ÒDialogue Platform on the Human DimensionÓ, comprised representatives of government agencies, civil society, parliament and international organizations. It has been tasked with coordinating the implementation of recommendations from the universal periodic review, from the mandate holders of the special procedures of the Human Rights Council and from the human rights treaty bodies. The Government adopted an action plan for effective implementation of the recommendations of the first review and indicated that a similar approach would be utilized for the implementation of recommendations received during the second review. 

7. The delegation expressed KazakhstanÕs commitment to the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms, which have remained the highest priorities. 


Sustainable development also remained a priority area in the countryÕs development. Initiatives such as ÒGlobal Energy StrategyÓ and the ÒGreen BridgeÓ partnership programme aimed at achieving sustainable development. The main State priorities outlined in the policy document ÒStrategy Ð 2050Ó called for progress toward durable democracy, the rule of law and protection of fundamental rights and freedoms.  

8. Kazakhstan has recorded substantive economic growth. The countryÕs gross domestic product increased substantially and Kazakhstan has featured among the top five fastest growing economies in 2013. This has enabled Kazakhstan to significantly increase budget spending on education and health. 

9. Kazakhstan has achieved the Millennium Development Goals on poverty reduction, access to education and gender equality. The country has therefore adopted the agenda of the ÒMDG +Ó, including advanced targets.  

10. The protection of maternal and infant health remained an important national priority. Efforts to improve related indicators contributed to the achievement of Goal 6 and a reduction in HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis infection rates. The Government continued its efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emission indicators in order to achieve Goal 7.  

11. Due to progress in industrialization, Kazakhstan has achieved high levels of employment with decent wages. The Government supported small and medium-sized businesses. The National Chamber of Entrepreneurs was established in order to protect the rights of businesses. Recently, a national concept of corporate social responsibility has been in the process of discussion.  

12. The delegation reported on measures undertaken to improve the populationÕs access to public services, including through the use of information technology. Representatives of civil society took part in various advisory and expert groups that worked to analyse and practice the human rights legal framework. 

13. The Government has been modernizing the national pension system. It also took measures to ensure access to housing through various programmes. Programmes have also been implemented to improve infrastructures, focusing primarily on access to drinking water in rural areas.  

14. The protection of the rights of persons with disabilities, especially children and young people, remained an integral part of social policy. The Government has implemented a national action plan to protect and improve quality of life for persons with disabilities. The delegation noted the GovernmentÕs cooperation with civil society on various social projects. The delegation also reported on work towards the creation of an Ombudsman for the Rights of the Child.  

15. The Government has revised its approaches to migration and made improvements in the visa regime, including the introduction of visa-free travel for tourism and investment, to attract foreign labour and capital.  

16. The delegation noted some achievements made in ensuring inter-ethnic and interreligious peace and harmony in the country and expressed its readiness to share KazakhstanÕs experiences in establishing unique inter-ethnic and interfaith bodies, including the ÒAssembly of PeopleÓ and the ÒCongress of World ReligionsÓ.  

17. The Government undertook the revision of a number of laws, including its Criminal and Criminal Procedural Codes, in order to strengthen the rule of law and improve the administration of justice. The revised Criminal Codes paid special attention to the broader use of alternative measures to imprisonment and strengthened legal safeguards for persons involved in criminal procedures. A law was adopted to ensure legal assistance by the State, especially to persons belonging to vulnerable groups. An online database of domestic 


legislation has been created to ensure free access to legal documents. The delegation noted a number of measures taken to ensure better protection of personsÕ rights and liberty, including continuous modernization of law-enforcement agencies.  

18. The delegation provided responses to a number of advanced questions. Regarding the death penalty, Kazakhstan has been firmly moving towards gradual abolition. Despite the fact that Kazakhstan has not yet ratified the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, aiming at the abolition of the death penalty (ICCPR-OP 2), the Government has followed international standards by declaring a moratorium on the death penalty and by utilizing alternatives to life imprisonment.  

19. In relation to the use of torture, the delegation stated that Kazakhstan has applied a strict policy of zero tolerance. A national preventive mechanism has been established to prevent torture based on the model of ÒOmbudsman +Ó.  

20. The Government continued to pay special attention to combating trafficking in human beings. With respect to visits of the special mandate holders of the Human Rights Council, the delegation emphasized that, in 2009, Kazakhstan issued a standing invitation to all special mandate holders.  

21. Domestic legislation was reformed to bring it into line with the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees. Therefore, stateless persons have been entitled to the right to work in Kazakhstan. The law prohibited the expulsion of refugees and asylum seekers in the case of threats to life and freedom.  

22. The delegation expressed the GovernmentÕs commitment to continue its work towards further improvement of national legislation and practice in human rights, taking into account international standards and commitments. The Government acknowledged that building democracy and the rule of law requires continuous efforts and progressive realization.

Following the 2014 visit by the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief, who had taken positive note of the regulation of religious activities, consultations were being held with experts on amendments to the Religious Activities Act. 

58. The delegation stated that Kazakhstan was party to various instruments to protect childrenÕs rights. Legislation provided protection, in particular to vulnerable children, while an inter-agency system protected neglected children from violence and ill-treatment. A Committee for the Protection of ChildrenÕs Rights supported the inter-agency provision of social, medical, legal and other services for children. The new Criminal Code established criminal liability for the sexual or economic exploitation of children, kidnapping or trafficking of children and for violence perpetrated against children. A lifetime ban on working with children was imposed on persons who had been convicted of sexual offences against children. Kazakhstan had achieved Goal 2 on achieving universal primary education. Furthermore, it enjoyed high levels of literacy and had launched a State programme to develop education that would ensure high quality instruction throughout the country. The children of immigrants enjoyed the same rights to secondary, technical and tertiary education as Kazakh citizens. Levels of female participation in education were high, with gender parity visible throughout the education system and high numbers of female teachers in secondary schools. 

59. The delegation stated that the new Criminal Code was intended to increase public confidence in the justice system, extend the powers of the court and reduce the prison population. New categories for offences should serve to prevent crime and two new chapters provided for medical crimes and computer-related crimes. Persons convicted of corruption were banned from holding official State positions. Alternative measures to deprivation of liberty were emphasized, while the penalties for dangerous crimes had been toughened.  

60. Regarding the questions on defamation, the delegation stated that a defamation case could only be launched at the request of a citizen. Although defamation was addressed by the Criminal Code, proceedings were akin to civil cases and the public prosecutor played no role in such cases. The process of launching a case had been simplified, in order to protect citizenÕs rights and guarantee that cases could be dealt with more quickly and thoroughly.  

61. The rights and responsibilities of detainees were read aloud to them on arrest and evidence obtained from a person whose detention had not complied with procedures was inadmissible. Cooperation and plea deals had been introduced, along with various limitations on criminal proceedings. CitizensÕ rights and freedoms were protected by two-


step judicial monitoring and all the measures introduced complied with the international and domestic obligations of Kazakhstan. Appeals could be made against decisions by the prosecutor and some of the prosecutorÕs authority had been transferred to the court under the new Criminal Code. 

62. At present, the Government was considering the ratification of CRPD and efforts were under way to provide for persons with disabilities, particularly with regard to improving access to services and transport and fostering a positive approach to persons with disabilities in society. National policies ensured the provision of modern medical assistance and free aid and rehabilitation was available to victims of radiation from the Semipalatinsk nuclear test zone, as well as other social benefits and compensation.  

63. The Trade Unions Act of 2014 clearly indicated the organization of the trade union movement and increased its role in protecting workersÕ rights and interests. Trade unions could be formed without prior authorization and local trade unions could join together to form an organization. 

64. Kazakhstan enjoyed a wide range of media outlets, the majority of which were not operated by the State. Digital broadcasting was being introduced and satellite broadcasts were available throughout the country. Internet access was being expanded and the State provided support to help regional media outlets move online. The suspension or cease of media activities could be ordered by the outlet owner or the court.  

65. The delegation noted that the new national human rights action plan would be developed for the period 2015-2020. It is envisaged that the new plan would include a special section, outlining necessary measures for the protection of the rights of human rights defenders. 

66. Portugal expressed regret that the number of crimes that were grounds for the imposition of the death penalty had increased under the new Criminal Code. It enquired about planned measures to improve respect for womenÕs rights and to reduce gender inequalities. Portugal made recommendations. 

67. The Republic of Korea welcomed the national plan in support of persons with disabilities, the project to ensure the effectiveness of criminal cases against violations of constitutional rights and the adoption of the Broadcasting Act. It made recommendations. 

68. The Russian Federation noted with satisfaction progress in achieving inter-ethnic and interfaith accord, economic development, political stability, realization of the right to education, health and access to health care as well as in improving national legislation. It made recommendations.

I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
A. Presentation by the State under review 
5. 
The head of the Ivorian delegation said that his countryÕs national report had been submitted in accordance with paragraph 5 of the annex to Human Rights Council resolution 16/21. The report had been prepared by a national universal periodic review team, the inherent difficulties faced by any administration emerging from a crisis notwithstanding. The results obtained had been extensively consolidated and shared with Ivorian civil society. 

6. 
Structured around 13 main points, the C™te dÕIvoire report could be summarized in three themes: the development of the normative and institutional framework; follow-up to and implementation of the recommendations and commitments arising from the universal periodic review; and the expectations of C™te dÕIvoire in terms of capacity-building and technical assistance. 

7. 
C™te dÕIvoire had made efforts to bring its legal provisions into line with international standards. The Ivorian authorities had taken many steps to strengthen the national normative and institutional framework by adopting a number of laws and establishing operational structures. 

8. 
C™te dÕIvoire had adopted the law on the insertion of article 85 bis into title VI of the Constitution and on the International Criminal Court; the law on the establishment, remit, organization and operation of the National Human Rights Commission of C™te dÕIvoire in accordance with the Paris Principles; the law on marriage, whose objective was to create de facto and de jure equality in Ivorian households; the law to amend the Nationality Code in relation to the procedure for acquiring nationality by marriage; particular provisions concerning the acquisition of nationality by declaration; the law on rural landownership; and the bill on sustainable development. 

9. 
C™te dÕIvoire had established several operational structures, including the Commission against Gender-Based Violence, the National Commission for the Family and the National Social Cohesion Programme. 

10. 
In March 2012, C™te dÕIvoire had adopted the National Development Plan, a unifying framework for the implementation of all national development policies, structured around six areas: defence, security, justice and the rule of law; education, health, employment and social affairs; economy, agriculture and the private sector; infrastructure, water, energy and mines; environment, quality of life and habitat, public services; and culture, youth and sport. 

11. 
The national policy for the promotion and protection of human rights, introduced by the Ivorian Government in 2011, was monitored by the Ministry of Justice, Human Rights and Civil Liberties. A bill on the protection of human rights defenders had been drafted in cooperation with civil society and adopted by the Council of Ministers in September 2013. 

12. 
C™te dÕIvoire had made progress by acceding to the 1954 Convention relating to the Status of Stateless Persons and the 1961 Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness in October 2013; to the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict in March 2012; and to the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women in January 2012. 

13. 
C™te dÕIvoire had ratified the Protocol to the African Charter on Human and PeoplesÕ Rights on the Rights of Women in Africa in March 2012, and the amendment to the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and Their Disposal in September 2013. 

14. 
During the previous universal periodic review, C™te dÕIvoire had received 147 recommendations. It had accepted 108 of them, expressed reservations or observations in relation to 37 and rejected 2. Despite the many crises it had gone through, C™te dÕIvoire had spared no effort in ensuring that it implemented a large proportion of the recommendations. 

15. 
The recommendations regarding the countryÕs political situation and overcoming the crisis had been implemented fully, as was demonstrated by the adoption of the following measures: the organization of elections in the aftermath of the crisis in accordance with the Ouagadougou Agreement, the redeployment of the administration across the entire national territory, the establishment of the Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration authority, the establishment of the new National Human Rights Commission in line with the Paris Principles, the creation of the Dialogue, Truth and Reconciliation Commission, the ratification of the Rome Statute and full cooperation with the International Criminal Court, the establishment of a national post-crisis commission of inquiry, the establishment of a special investigation unit, the introduction of human rights and citizenship education into curricula, and the adoption of a national strategy on sustainable development. 

16. 
The recommendations being implemented were primarily related to the progressive realization of economic, social and cultural rights. The Ivorian people welcomed the GovernmentÕs efforts in many development sectors, such as health, through the 

refurbishment, construction and fitting out of health facilities, the provision of free medical care for mothers and children, and specific programmes to combat pandemics (AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, etc.); education, through the refurbishment of the 5 public universities, the construction and refurbishment of 4,478 primary- and secondary-school classrooms, the recruitment, as an exceptional measure, of 8,000 teachers, the introduction of school canteens and the distribution of 6,880,600 textbooks and 5,762,334 school kits that had enabled more than 90 per cent of students enrolled in primary school to take advantage of free education; and road infrastructure.  

17. 
Ivorians also welcomed the increase in the minimum wage, from 35,000 CFA francs (70 dollars) to 60,000 CFA francs (120 dollars). Similarly, State workers had received a salary increase in January 2014. 

18. 
C™te dÕIvoire was determined to implement the recommendations of the universal periodic review. However, because of a lack of resources, it had not been able to fully implement them given other priorities in the aftermath of the crisis. 

19. 
C™te dÕIvoire was presenting its needs in the area of the promotion and protection of human rights to the whole international community. Countries such as C™te dÕIvoire, emerging from crisis, faced huge difficulties in guaranteeing their citizens full enjoyment of their human rights. For that reason, the United Nations, so as to encourage international solidarity among its members, made available a variety of mechanisms to support requesting States. 

20. 
It was incumbent on States to ensure the promotion and respect of the human rights of their citizens.  

21. 
C™te dÕIvoire, mindful of that fundamental task but also of its current limitations, wished to make a solemn appeal to the entire United Nations system as well as to multilateral and bilateral partners to support its efforts in seven priority areas: peacebuilding; treaty body reports; combating violence against women and improving their living conditions; improving prison policy; adopting a national human rights policy; and working towards national reconciliation.

After those statements, most of which concerned the recommendations by the States parties, the head of the delegation welcomed the relevant and very useful contributions by the States parties aimed at strengthening the promotion and protection of human rights in C™te dÕIvoire. He also responded to two of the questions raised. 

69. 
In response to the question of Montenegro with regard to the level of cooperation between C™te dÕIvoire and the International Criminal Court since the ratification of the Rome Statute, he said that there was good cooperation.

70. 
With regard to combating impunity, he said that C™te dÕIvoire was working towards achieving zero impunity.

74. 
However, the Government was in the process of reactivating the decree on the establishment of a committee to monitor implementation of international human rights instruments. That committee would, among other tasks, prepare the summary and periodic reports of C™te dÕIvoire to the relevant bodies of the United Nations and the African Commission on Human and PeoplesÕ Rights. 

75. 
With regard to the ratification of international human rights instruments, the head of the delegation said that there were no obstacles to the ratification of the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance or the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, aiming at the abolition of the death penalty. C™te dÕIvoire was a party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, article 6 of which suggested abolishing the death penalty. 

76. 
As for the harmonization of national legislation with international standards, C™te dÕIvoire intended to address shortcomings in relation to rape as part of its reform of the standard codes. However, it should be borne in mind that articles 354 and 356 of the Ivorian Criminal Code criminalized rape and sexual harassment. C™te dÕIvoire had ratified the Rome Statute on 15 February 2013.

85.

It called on the international community to provide support and assistance for implementation of the recommendations regarding, inter alia, poverty, discrimination, violence against women, FGM and detention conditions. 

86.

expressed concern regarding victims of sexual violence, and discrimination against persons with albinism.

It paid tribute to the countryÕs commitment to and cooperation with the review, and highlighted its efforts to implement recommendations accepted during the first UPR cycle. 

89. 
Sweden welcomed the positive developments regarding the prosecution of sexual violence, but expressed concern regarding FGM. Although assistance was provided to victims of rape and domestic violence, impunity remained a concern. It welcomed the efforts to pursue reconciliation and disarmament, although much remained to be done. 

90. 
Switzerland expressed concern about the lack of judicial impartiality regarding human rights violations and acts of torture, the number of people at risk of statelessness, the number of cases of sexual violence, and violations of the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex persons and of those with HIV/AIDS. 

91. 
Thailand encouraged the extending of a standing invitation to special procedures mandate holders. It expressed concern about human rights violations, harmful gender stereotypes, and a lack of access to justice for women. It commended the ratification by C™te dÕIvoire of OP-CEDAW, the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict (OP-CRC-AC) and the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography (OP-CRC-SC). 

92. 
The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia asked about measures taken to address corruption in the judiciary, create an independent judiciary and overcome impunity. Welcoming the ratification of OP-CRC-AC and OP-CRC-SC, it urged the country to fulfil its reporting obligations under the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT). Sexual violence remained a concern.

  Introduction 
1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, established in accordance with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its twentieth session from 27 October to 7 November 2014. The review of Fiji was held at the 5th meeting, on 29 October 2014. The delegation of Fiji was headed by Aiyaz Sayed-Khaiyum, Attorney-General and Minister of Justice. At its 10th meeting, held on 31 October 2014, the Working Group adopted the report on Fiji. 
2. On 15 January 2014, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Fiji: Japan, Namibia and the Russian Federation. 
3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1 and paragraph 5 of the annex to resolution 16/21, the following documents were issued for the review of Fiji: 
(a) A national report submitted/written presentation made in accordance with paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/20/FJI/1);  
(b) A compilation prepared by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) (A/HRC/WG.6/20/FJI/2); 
(c) A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) (A/HRC/WG.6/20/FJI/3).  
4. A list of questions prepared in advance by Belgium, Germany, Liechtenstein, Mexico, Netherlands, Slovenia, Spain and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland was transmitted to Fiji through the troika. The questions are available on the extranet of the universal periodic review (UPR). 
 I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
 A. Presentation by the State under review 
5. Opening statements by the Fijian delegation were made by the Attorney-General and Minister for Justice, the Chief Justice, the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Chairman of the Media Industry Development Authority. 
6. The commitment of Fiji to promoting and protecting the fundamental principles and values of universal human rights set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights had been affirmed in the Fijian Constitution adopted on 7 September 2013. The first Constitution in Fiji to eliminate the legal enforcement of ethnic voting and to include social and economic rights, as well as civil and political rights, it had created a transformative human rights normative framework for the people of Fiji. Under the Constitution, the State was legally obliged to protect and promote those rights. 
7. Fiji had held elections under the Constitution on 17 September 2014, with an 84.6 per cent participation rate of registered voters, and a record low 0.75 per cent of invalid ballots. In a preliminary statement, the Multinational Observer Group had deemed the elections credible and representative of the will of the Fijian people. 
8. In addition to the human rights set forth in the core international human rights instruments, Fiji urged the Human Rights Council to address emerging human rights issues 
including trans-border impacts of climate change, asylum policies and consequences of free trade agreements on social and economic rights. 
9. In response to questions on the ratification of international human rights instruments from Belgium, Mexico and the United Kingdom, Fiji confirmed that it was not a party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, or the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. Nonetheless, the robust Bill of Rights in the Constitution went beyond obligations under those instruments and placed an obligation on the State to promote and protect those rights for all Fijians. Those rights were applied directly by the Fijian judiciary. Approval of the ratification of those international instruments was the prerogative of Parliament. 
10. Fiji remained amenable to inviting special procedures mandate holders to visit the country. However, it was operating in an entirely new political, social and legislative environment. Fiji wanted to be in a position to ratify those instruments and have the resources to host and meet the standards of the mandate holders before inviting them. 
11. WomenÕs rights in Fiji were in line with the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), which Fiji had ratified in 1995. In response to questions from ten countries on steps taken to end discrimination and violence against women, Fiji acknowledged the challenges posed by those issues. New initiatives included updated provisions in the Crimes Decree for the offences of rape and sexual assault, the passing and application of the Domestic Violence Decree, judicial training, a new National Gender Policy and gender training for civil servants. Fiji corrected the claim made by the Netherlands that the Constitution did not protect women by listing the newly protected grounds, in addition to sex and gender, in the Bill of Rights, which included gender identity and expression, pregnancy and marital status, and constituted broad protection from discrimination against women, allowing for the legal expression of intersectional discrimination. It was also clarified that the higher levels of reported cases of domestic violence, about which concern had been raised, in fact reflected higher reporting by victims owing to their confidence in the above-mentioned initiatives. 
12. Those measures would only be meaningful if all stakeholders played their part in shaping societyÕs attitudes towards zero tolerance of discrimination and violence against women. Training and participation by the police, civil society, the judiciary and prosecutors was also required. It was important for civil society organizations to familiarize themselves with those laws and initiatives because they were empowered to represent women in the legal system under the Domestic Violence Decree. 
13. The Domestic Violence Decree did not establish domestic violence as an offence; the charge would remain one of assault under the Crimes Decree. However, there were important provisions in the Domestic Violence Decree that could be used to protect women. 
14. Responding to questions from Belgium and Estonia on the International Criminal Court, the delegation said that Fiji had been one of the first States to ratify the Rome Statute and it remained steadfastly committed to the International Criminal Court. The countryÕs domestic legislation is in full complementarity with the provisions of the Rome Statute and domestic legislation through the Crimes Decree. 
15. Responding to questions from Ethiopia and Switzerland on rights vis-ˆ-vis limitations in the Fijian Constitution, Fiji explained that the burden was on the State to prove that the limitations were necessary. The law must always promote the values that underlay a democratic society based on human dignity, equality and freedom. In addition, section 7 of the Bill of Rights, underpinning those democratic principles, guided the courtsÕ interpretations and allowed them to consider international law in their decisions. 
16. Responding to questions about the abolition of the death penalty asked by France, Germany and Namibia, Fiji noted that it had abolished the death penalty in 2001. However, it remained in the Military Code indirectly, by virtue of the applicability of the Army Act 1955 of the United Kingdom. Fiji announced that in the forthcoming session of Parliament, the Military Code would be amended to remove the reference to the death penalty altogether. 
17. Responding to questions and recommendations from Germany, New Zealand and the Republic of Korea on human rights abuses, in particular alleged torture and ill-treatment by the police, Fiji explained that, in cases in which complaints were made to the police, and in which the Director of Public Prosecutions determined that there was sufficient evidence for prosecution, the perpetrators had been prosecuted. Indeed, some were currently serving terms of imprisonment for such acts. 
18. The new legal framework of Fiji under the Constitution allowed steps to be taken to ensure that police procedures were modernized and made more transparent. It was acknowledged that torture during interrogation had been a long-standing problem in Fiji, owing to cultural misconceptions inherited from attitudes prevalent in Europe within living memory. Therefore, in order to avoid lengthy court proceedings to determine whether confessions and statements had been obtained under torture, the judiciary had itself provided budgetary resources to launch a project under which all interviews of suspects in custody would be video recorded, and would provide additional funds and training for the investigators. That had been done in recognition of the fact that institutions must combine their resources in order to eliminate impropriety and violent treatment, and to ensure a more efficient justice system. 
19. The police had also acknowledged deficiencies in police investigations and aspects of police culture that in the past had excused or ignored police brutality, and that training was needed in the areas of domestic violence and interrogations. Specialized organizations had been invited to cooperate with relevant Fijian agencies in the provision of such training so as to improve the human rights standing of the criminal justice system in Fiji. In further response to concerns raised about assaults and brutality in police custody, the delegation explained that, in cases in which evidence had been obtained by means of assault by the police, the prosecution would not continue and the matter would be referred to the Commissioner of Police for investigation and possible criminal charges against the officers. Such cases had most recently resulted in the prosecution and conviction of three police officers who had been convicted of murder by joint enterprise, and two who had been convicted of being accessories after the fact when a young man had died in police custody. 
20. The Fijian criminal justice system was explained, with particular emphasis on the processes followed between the lodging of a criminal complaint and the decision on whether or not to proceed with the prosecution. It was emphasized that the police were also independent of the Government and the Director of Public Prosecutions with regard to how police investigations were conducted, and that the police could only act if a formal written complaint was made by a person, including if the complaint was one of unfair treatment by the police.  
 B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review 
21. During the interactive dialogue, 54 delegations made statements. Recommendations made during the dialogue can be found in section II of the present report. 
22. Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of) commended efforts on social development, poverty reduction, the health service, decent housing and the risk of natural disasters. The 
National Policy on Persons Living with Disabilities and free primary and secondary education were noted. It made recommendations. 
23. Algeria welcomed the Constitution establishing universal principles and the strengthened legal framework for human rights, particularly regarding elections and political participation. Policies addressing persons with disabilities and older persons, and efforts to address living standards were appreciated. Algeria made recommendations. 
24. Argentina offered its congratulations on the introduction of the National Gender Policy promoting gender equality, social justice and sustainable development. Argentina referred to its work with France and other countries on an international campaign to encourage ratification of the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance (ICPPED) and made recommendations. 
25. Australia welcomed the 2014 elections and the provisional recognition of their credibility from the Multinational Observer Group. Australia noted the importance of supporting the democratic role of civil society and the media. Australia commended the International Labour Organization (ILO) direct contacts mission and noted the continued need for close engagement with labour partners. Australia made recommendations. 
26. Bangladesh noted progress, despite the challenges faced and the vulnerability of Fiji to natural disasters, highlighting the Constitution, improvements in womenÕs and childrenÕs health and resources for education. WomenÕs involvement in public life and decision-making, and gender-based violence were reported areas of concern. Bangladesh made recommendations. 
27. Belgium welcomed the introduction of electoral legislation and the revocation of the Public Emergency Regulations 2009, while recognizing ongoing human rights challenges. The National Gender Policy was noted, although gender-based violence was prevalent, and the importance of freedom of expression and assembly were emphasized. Belgium made recommendations. 
28. Brazil commended Fiji for the successful general elections and the appointment of women to ministerial and assistant ministerial positions. It was concerned about restrictions on freedom of opinion and expression and the percentage of the population living below the poverty line. Brazil made recommendations. 
29. Canada asked what steps were being taken to ensure full protection of the rights to freedom of expression, opinion, association and assembly. It welcomed the news that women accounted for 16 per cent of the new Parliament and the election of a female Speaker of Parliament. It made recommendations. 
30. Chile encouraged action to ensure the independence of the judiciary, restrict the scope of emergency legislation, guarantee freedom of expression, and compensate victims of human rights violations. It made recommendations. 
31. China commended Fiji for its commitment to gender equality and social justice, the National Policy on Persons Living with Disabilities and the National Council for Older Persons. It also commended the increase in investment aimed at guaranteeing free primary and secondary education. It made a recommendation. 
32. Costa Rica encouraged speedier action to ratify core human rights instruments, and urged Fiji to continue cooperating with treaty bodies and special procedures. It welcomed the steps that were being taken to remove the death penalty from all legal instruments. It made recommendations. 
33. Cuba commended the steps being taken by Fiji to meet the needs of persons with disabilities and to ensure access to free primary and secondary education. Cuba urged the 
international community to support national efforts for issues identified as priorities. It made a recommendation. 
34. Denmark welcomed the new GovernmentÕs undertaking to ratify all core human rights instruments. Noting that steps to ratify the Convention against Torture (CAT) were already under way, it encouraged the Government to seek the assistance of the Convention against Torture Initiative. Denmark made recommendations. 
35. Estonia noted that the drafting of the Constitution had not been all-inclusive. It urged Fiji to abolish decrees restricting media freedom, put a stop to the intimidation and harassment of persons who criticized the State, and ensure zero tolerance of violence against women. It made recommendations. 
36. Ethiopia enquired about the impact of legal restrictions applicable to certain constitutional rights on individualsÕ enjoyment of the rights concerned. It noted the existence of restrictions on the capacity of law enforcement bodies to interpret the countryÕs human rights obligations. It made a recommendation. 
37. France welcomed the restoration of parliamentary democracy and the adoption of the new Constitution, which had put an end to major discrimination on ethnic grounds. France made recommendations. 
38. Germany welcomed the Bill of Rights contained in the new Constitution. It commended the abolitionist approach taken towards the death penalty for over two decades. Germany made recommendations. 
39. Fiji indicated that the Human Rights and Anti-Discrimination Commission would now serve as the predominant enforcement body for the Bill of Rights guaranteed under the Constitution. The Constitution provided for the independence of the Commission in its functions and in the exercise of its authority and powers, including administrative autonomy and control over its own budget and finances. In order to fulfil its mandate, which included enforcing and monitoring compliance with the human rights instruments ratified by the Government, including by bringing proceedings before the courts, Parliament had to provide adequate funding and resources for the Commission. OHCHR and development partners were invited to work with the Government to strengthen the capacity of the Commission and ensure compliance with the principles relating to the status of national institutions for the promotion and protection of human rights (Paris Principles). 
40. The meritocracy approach to the Fijian public service had done away with discriminatory policies that had promoted an elite agenda and clique rather than addressing the inequalities they had claimed to address. 
41. The Chief Justice refuted any insinuations that the Fijian judiciary was not independent and that it was subject to the direction and control of the Government. The appointment of judicial officers was handled by the Judicial Services Commission, and consultation with, not concurrence or approval of, the Attorney-General was required. In the case of disagreement, it was ultimately the CommissionÕs final decision. Comments to the effect that the Government controlled the judiciary were therefore erroneous. Representation on the Commission of members and non-members of the Bar, and video recording of its proceedings, were a noticeable improvement from the situation under the 1997 Constitution. The appointment process of members to the Commission was considerably less subject to political influence and control. Furthermore, new protections had been introduced into the 2013 Constitution providing for the independence and autonomy of the judiciary, in section 97. 
42. The only two judicial appointments controlled by the Government were those of the Chief Justice and the President of the Court of Appeal, under procedures that were the same as those contained in the 1997 Constitution, and similar to other jurisdictions. The 
arrangements under the current Constitution for judicial appointments were a noticeable improvement from previous constitutions. 
43. The only interference in the Fijian judiciary had been the travel bans placed by Australia and New Zealand on members of the Fijian judiciary appointed after 2009, which had prevented suitably qualified persons who might have served on the judicial bench from doing so. Sri Lankan assistance in allowing the secondment of its judiciary to Fiji had enabled the judiciary in Fiji to continue to function effectively. 
44. Section 97 of the Fijian Constitution had brought the judiciary into compliance with the Basic Principles on the Independence of the Judiciary and the Basic Principles on the Role of Lawyers. 
45. The Chief Justice said that a substantial training programme had been put in place for the judiciary in order to enable all its members to be fully cognizant with human rights issues, including awareness of and sensitivity to gender issues and children in court. Training input and assistance from specialist non-governmental organizations (NGOs) would be welcomed. However, the judiciary could not discuss individual cases with NGOs, and requests for information and letters seeking intervention with a view to appeal were better addressed to the Director of Public Prosecutions. 
46. Other developments in the judicial sector had included the introduction of sittings conducted in open court, except in cases involving childrenÕs evidence, trade secrets, copyright or national security. Video recording of all court proceedings would also be introduced in the near future. In order to improve access to justice, and in line with the Bill of Rights in the Constitution, new lifts for the disabled, crches, and rooms for vulnerable witnesses had been introduced in courts. 
47. The Chief Justice had issued a directive indicating that no case in which the applicability of ouster clauses was challenged could be rejected by registry staff on initial filing. All such cases must be listed before a judge for his/her ruling on that jurisdictional matter. Discussions would be ongoing with organizations such as ILO on providing training sessions for judges and lawyers in relevant areas. 
48. Ghana welcomed the entry into force of the new Constitution, which took into account the rights of children and of persons with disabilities. Ghana made recommendations. 
49. India commended the holding of democratic elections, the adoption of the Constitution, the commitment to ratifying core human rights treaties, the allocation of resources to promote access to justice, the HIV/AIDS Decree, the National Policy on Persons Living with Disabilities and the National Gender Policy. India made recommendations. 
50. Indonesia welcomed the results of the elections, in which Fijians had freely exercised their right to vote. It recalled the ten-year time frame set by the Government to ratify the core human rights treaties. It commended efforts to combat discrimination against women, particularly through the National Gender Policy. Indonesia made recommendations. 
51. Ireland urged Fiji to cooperate fully with special procedures. It expressed concern about restrictions on freedom of expression under the Constitution and the Media Decree and the impact of the Public Order Amendment Decree on the exercise of freedom of peaceful assembly. Ireland made recommendations. 
52. Israel commended the holding of free and fair elections and the adoption of the Constitution, which enshrined non-negotiable principles and values such as a common and equal citizenry, a secular State and social justice. It asked whether concrete measures were 
being taken to maintain a judiciary that was independent of the Government and the military. Israel made a recommendation. 
53. Italy appreciated the GovernmentÕs commitment to ratify the outstanding human rights instruments within ten years. It welcomed the steps taken to strengthen womenÕs rights and commended the ratification of CEDAW and the adoption of the National Gender Policy. It encouraged the authorities to combat stereotypical attitudes to women and violence against women. Italy made recommendations. 
54. Japan welcomed the positive developments to promote the democratic process, but expressed concern about the broad grounds under the Constitution for restrictions on freedom of expression, opinion, association and assembly. It encouraged Fiji to further promote womenÕs status and increase their participation in decision-making processes. Japan made recommendations. 
55. Kenya enquired about progress in ratifying core human rights instruments. It noted that the 2009 Human Rights Commission Decree affected the CommissionÕs independence and functionality. Kenya made recommendations. 
56. Kuwait commended Fiji for its commitment to ratifying all core human rights treaties and the steps it had taken to enhance and implement the Strategic Development Plan. Kuwait made a recommendation. 
57. Lebanon welcomed the steps taken to safeguard political, social, economic and cultural freedoms and freedom of the media, thereby consolidating democracy and equal rights. It commended in particular the adoption of the Constitution and the holding of general elections. Lebanon made recommendations. 
58. Malaysia appreciated the implementation of various policies and plans, as recommended during the first review. Positive updates in education, information and communications technology, housing, womenÕs empowerment and childrenÕs rights were welcomed, alongside the Constitution and free elections. Engagement with the international community was noted. Malaysia made recommendations. 
59. Maldives welcomed the Constitution and congratulated the Government on successful elections and its commitment to democratic consolidation and the rule of law. It also welcomed the efforts to reduce carbon emissions and mitigate and adapt to climate change. Maldives made a recommendation. 
60. Montenegro asked about progress towards ratification of core human rights treaties, implementation of the National Gender Policy, measures to ensure gender equality in law and practice, and discussions on removing the death penalty from the Military Code. Montenegro made recommendations. 
61. Morocco welcomed the holding of elections, the implementation of the Roadmap for Democracy, which targeted revitalization of the national economy and the elimination of ethnic discrimination, and the progressive Constitution. It asked for an update on the implementation of the Domestic Violence Decree. Morocco made recommendations. 
62. Namibia commended progress in the sphere of civil and political rights. It noted strengthened human rights institutions and the new Constitution, which provided for an independent judiciary, human rights for all and equal access to the law. Namibia made recommendations. 
63. The Netherlands appreciated the return to democracy, the Constitution and the WomenÕs Plan of Action. Concerns were raised that gender equality had not been established in the Constitution and that no comprehensive law criminalized all forms of gender-based violence. The Netherlands made recommendations. 
64. New Zealand welcomed recent elections, the successful first sitting of Parliament and the ILO direct contacts mission. The situation of human rights defenders was a concern. It noted investigations into violence in custody and the reconvening of the Fiji Law Society. It made recommendations. 
65. Norway noted that the Constitution enshrined the principles of equality, non-discrimination and an independent judiciary and established the rights of indigenous Fijians. The September elections had been a significant step. An active role for Fiji in the Human Rights Council would be welcomed. Norway made recommendations. 
66. The Philippines noted the strengthening of democratic processes and protection for vulnerable groups. It asked whether resources for socioeconomic programmes had been allocated and how development partners could help. It also asked what barriers there were to the functioning of the judiciary and how the international community could provide assistance. It made a recommendation. 
67. In response to the questions pertaining to the media and freedom of speech, of expression and of the press, Fiji stated that it did not accept the premise of the questions asked on the Media Industry Development Decree, since those questions had implied or stated outright that the media framework was restrictive and/or that there was censorship of the media. 
68. Through its Bill of Rights, the Fijian Constitution unequivocally recognized freedom of the press as pivotal to the realization of freedom of speech, expression, thought, opinion and publication. 
69. Fiji shared the concerns that had been voiced about the fact that repressive laws could severely restrict press freedom. Fiji had taken significant steps in securing greater rights and freedoms. However, no country guaranteed unfettered freedom without responsibility. While guaranteeing freedom of speech, expression, thought, opinion and of the press, the Constitution explicitly prohibited any speech, opinion or expression that was tantamount to war propaganda, incitement to violence or insurrection against the Constitution, or advocated hatred based on any of the prohibited grounds of discrimination, which included race, culture, ethnic or social origin, sex, gender, sexual orientation and gender identity, language, economic, social or health status, disability, age and religion. Those limitations were also in line with general recommendation No. 35 of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination on combating racist hate speech. 
70. The Fijian Constitution contained a definition of hate speech that was comparable to that in the German legal framework, given the history of religious and racial intolerance. Training to ensure that the media understood where to draw the line between free speech and limitations on free speech in accordance with international law, especially the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights, was of paramount importance. 
71. The Public Emergency Regulations had been revoked. The Media Industry Development Decree 2010, through a very progressive Media Code of Ethics and the Constitution, guaranteed the freedom of the press and protected the confidentiality of journalistic sources, in line with a decision of the European Court of Human Rights and article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights. It also encouraged robust debate without inciting hatred and was consistent with the law on justifiable limitations to free speech under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the European Convention. It should be noted that the Media Code of Ethics in the Media Industry Development Decree 2010 had been copied verbatim from the Code of Ethics adopted by the previous self-regulated Media Council. 
72. The Media Industry Development Authority had called for balanced, accurate and evidence-based reporting, encouraging quality journalism that was ethical and followed internationally recognized protocols of responsible journalism. 
73. The Media Industry Development Decree 2010 provided for an independent media tribunal, presided over by a High Court judge, which adjudicated in cases of breaches of media codes or matters relating to media disputes. Only one prosecution had taken place under the Media Industry Development Authority, in relation to foreign ownership of a media organization. There had been no prosecution of any media organization for breaches of the Code of Ethics, or regarding media content. 
74. The Media Industry Development Authority had actively encouraged the mainstream media, both print and broadcast, to report freely and critically on public opinion and views, including those which were critical of the Government. The consistent call from the Media Industry Development Authority for self-regulation and continuous education of the media was consistent with the recent call from the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) in its 2014 report, ÒWorld trends in freedom of expression and media developmentÓ, to strengthen national legislative frameworks and the training of journalists in order to build capacity and improve media and information literacy, and to support media independence by promoting professional standards and self-regulation. 
75. Training for journalists had been conducted on the Media Code of Ethics, the Bill of Rights and on reporting the elections. In addition, there were plans to work with the United Nations Development Programme on training for the Fijian media on reporting parliamentary debates.

2. On 14 January 2013, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of rapporteurs (Troika) to facilitate the review of Bangladesh: Czech Republic, Ethiopia and Pakistan.

These questions are available on the extranet of the UPR. 
 I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
 A. Presentation by the State under review 
5. Foreign Minister of Bangladesh Dr. Dipu Moni, MP, started her presentation by expressing profound sadness at heavy loss of lives at collapse of a building in Bangladesh. 
6. She said that the Grand Alliance Government led by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina focused on building a robust normative and institutional framework during the last four years to ensure that all citizens enjoyed all human rights as guaranteed in the Constitution. She highlighted the 15th Amendment to the Constitution that restored the Fundamental Principles of State Policy for building a democratic, secular and socially just and inclusive Bangladesh. She underlined the measures taken to enhance the independence and effectiveness of the National Election Commission to hold free, fair and impartial national elections. The Foreign Minister informed that in the last four years the Parliament enacted 196 legislations, related to human rights one way or other, and ensured the function of its Standing Committees as effective bipartisan watchdogs. She also enumerated the steps taken to ensure the independence of judiciary and enhance the functional independence, effectiveness and credibility of the National Human Rights Commission, Anti-Corruption Commission and Information Commission. 
7. The Foreign Minister reaffirmed her GovernmentÕs unequivocal stand on Òzero toleranceÓ against human rights violation by the law enforcement agencies as well as on their impunity. She said that any incident of death during exchange of fire between law 
enforcement agencies and criminals is duly investigated as per existing laws and Codes of Conduct. She expressed concern over the rising trend of abduction under false personification of the law enforcement agencies (LEAs) and said that more than 540 such criminals had already been arrested. She reaffirmed the GovernmentÕs commitment to end the culture of impunity and recounted the initiatives taken to conclude the trials of the self-proclaimed killers of the countryÕs founding President and members of his family, and to hold the ongoing trials of the local perpetrators who committed crimes against humanity and genocide during the 1971 War of Liberation through domestic tribunals, pursuing the principle of complementarity under the Rome Statute. The Foreign Minister also reiterated her GovernmentÕs commitment to build a secular society and not to countenance any threat and attacks against the countryÕs religious minorities such as the attacks on Buddhists in Ramu the previous year or the recent attacks against the Hindu community. She highlighted the Constitutional recognition given to the countryÕs ethnic groups and tribal communities through the 15th Amendment and the measures taken to implement some of the critical issues under the Chittagong Hill Tracts Peace Accords (CHT). 
8. The Minister highlighted the role of the National Women Development Policy, 2011 in advancing womenÕs empowerment and the stringent laws on domestic violence prevention, anti-trafficking and pornography control to combat violence against women. She underlined the GovernmentÕs success in reducing child and infant mortality and current focus on increasing retention rate in schools, combating malnutrition and stunting, and eliminating child labour from hazardous sectors. The Foreign Minister referred to the National Labour Policy and the recent amendments to the Labour Act of 2006 to ensure better workplace safety and collective bargaining for workers. She also raised the human rights concerns of migrant workers and flagged the Expatriates Welfare Act, 2013 to promote their rights and well-being. The Foreign Minister elaborated on the concrete measures taken by her Government to protect the rights of the vulnerable and marginalized groups in society, including persons with disabilities and refugees, among others. 
9. The Minister underscored the impact of poverty on peopleÕs full enjoyment of human rights and reaffirmed the GovernmentÕs commitment to the Right to Development as an essential precondition for human rights. She enumerated the positive strides made during the last four years to reduce poverty by 10 per cent, enhance food security, improve public health through community clinics, and increase investment in the education and information technology (IT) sectors.

Introduction

The review of Turkmenistan was held at the 1st meeting on 22 April 2013. The delegation of Turkmenistan was headed by Vepa Hajiyev, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs. At its 10th meeting, held on 26 April 2013, the Working Group adopted the report on Turkmenistan. 
2. On 14 January 2013, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Turkmenistan: Botswana, Ecuador and the Philippines. 
3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 and paragraph 5 of the annex to resolution 16/21, the following documents were issued for the review of Turkmenistan: 
 (a) A national report submitted/written presentation made in accordance with paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/16/TKM/1);

 I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
 A. Presentation by the State under review 
5. The delegation reported that considerable progress had been made in the implementation of obligations undertaken by Turkmenistan in the framework of the universal periodic review. Changes had been made in legislation to bring it in line with international standards and reforms had been carried out in various areas under the leadership of the President of Turkmenistan. The national economy had been developing and investments in science, education, health, culture and social infrastructure had been increased. The delegation expressed confidence that constructive dialogue in the working group would enable the Government to enhance further the progress in promoting the progressive realization of human rights and freedoms. 
6. The delegation noted the efforts of Turkmenistan at the international level and its active participation and enhanced role in the work of a number of international organizations, including the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE). During the reporting period Turkmenistan acceded to a number of international human rights instruments, including the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) and its Optional Protocol (OP-CRPD), and the 1954 and 1961 Conventions on statelessness. 
7. The delegation stated that the National Commission on the improvement of legislation had developed recommendations to improve existing legislation and draft new laws and regulations by taking into account provisions of the international human rights treaties ratified by Turkmenistan. The Parliament had also taken measures to ensure the conformity of the newly adopted and amended laws with international law. The delegation pointed to several new laws that were adopted in the framework of reforms, including the Criminal Procedural Code and the Family Code, which incorporated the provisions of the relevant international human rights treaties. 
8. The delegation pointed out that the Government had paid heightened attention to the penitentiary system. Renovation work had been carried out in the penitentiary institutions and the construction of a new womenÕs prison would finish in 2013. Medical infrastructure had been improved in prisons and production units had been created to provide new job opportunities for prisoners. Substantial State budget allocations had been made for these efforts. The Government, in cooperation with the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) in Central Asia, had been implementing a plan of action within the framework of multilateral cooperation in the penitentiary system. According to the Plan, humanitarian visits by ICRC representatives to penitentiary institutions had been carried out since 2011.  Monitoring by ICRC found that conditions in juvenile correctional facilities met the international standards.

Introduction 
1. 
The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, established in accordance with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its seventeenth session from 21 October to 1 November 2013. The review of Jordan was held at the 7th meeting on 24 October 2013. The delegation of Jordan was headed by H.E. Dr. Mohammad Hussein Al Momani, Minister of State for Media Affairs and Communications. At its 14th meeting, held on 31 October 2013, the Working Group adopted the report on Jordan. 

2. 
On 14 January 2013, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Jordan: Libya, Montenegro and Thailand. 

3. 
In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1 and paragraph 5 of the annex to resolution 16/21, the following documents were issued for the review of Jordan:

I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
A. Presentation by the State under review 
5. 
In his introduction the head of the Jordanian delegation emphasized that the universal periodic review formed a chance for Jordan to assess its human rights situation based on self-criticism and reiterated JordanÕs commitment to collaborating with all partners to ensure the success of the mechanism and the success of the Human Rights Council. 

6. 
The delegation stated that over the past four years, there has been unprecedented progress in terms of reform and promotion of human rights and fundamental freedoms, despite the serious security implications and disorder witnessed in the region. These regional developments did not slow down the reform, but the Arab Spring, as His Majesty King Abdullah has repeatedly affirmed, is an opportunity to accelerate the reform process as a domestically-driven process and a model for the region. Jordanian reform is gradual and rooted in peaceful transformation, pluralism, societal consensus, tolerance and respect for the opinions of others. 

7. 
The delegation stated that the pillars of the reform are rooted in the Constitution which guarantees the protection of fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals. Accordingly, two years ago about one third of the articles of the Constitution were amended in compliance with international standards. The amended Constitution prohibits any violations of rights and freedoms, upholds dignity and provides physical and moral 

protection for all citizens. It also gives all Jordanians the right to work and to establish trade unions and political parties and ensures that the right to education is free and compulsory. 

8. 
The delegation stated that constitutional amendments also protect mothers and motherhood and people with disabilities. The amendments guarantee, inter alia, freedom of opinion, of the press and of expression, as well as literacy, artistic and cultural freedoms and privacy in personal communications, and that no civilian can be tried before non-civilian judges. Jordan has enacted legislation, including laws on political parties, elections, public gatherings and press and publications. The new Independent Election Commission enhances transparency and the Constitutional Court oversees the constitutionality of laws. 

9. 
The delegation stated that two major achievements in 2013 have marked the path to democracy and comprehensive reform: parliamentary elections in January took place in the framework of impartiality and transparency in accordance with the best international practices and with the observation of local and international monitors. Voter registration exceeded 70 per cent, despite calls for a boycott, and a 57 per cent voter turnout which was among the highest in the history of the country. All components of Jordanian society are now represented in the current parliament. Following the elections, the King voluntarily waived his constitutional right to appoint the Prime Minister and for the first time asked the parliament to make the nomination. The second important event was the holding of transparent municipal elections last August. In these elections the representation of women increased to 36 per cent from 25 per cent previously. Moreover, the King has recently issued four discussion papers in order to contribute to a national dialogue on the best democratic model to which Jordan aspires. 

10. 
The delegation highlighted the KingÕs order to the Government to amend the law of the State Security Court and limit its powers to the crimes of treason, espionage, terrorism, drug-related crimes and counterfeiting of currency. 

11. 
The delegation stated that in order to further strengthen the rights of women and their participation in public life and the promotion of equality and put an end to certain social practices, Jordan has introduced amendments to several laws. Additional new laws have been enacted, such as the Law on Protection from Domestic Violence, laws on the prohibition of trafficking in human beings while the Personal Status Law of 2010 enhanced the rights of women and children. The delegation emphasized that the Penal Code had been amended in order to put an end to practices that stand in the way of effective implementation of human rights, such as so-called crimes of honour. To enhance the status of women and to ensure the elimination of all forms of violence, the legislative amendments increased sanctions for crimes of physical violence and such crimes as rape, indecent assault, abduction, and sexual harassment. 

12. 
The delegation stated that in order to promote womenÕs participation in decision-making and raise the level of representation of women, the legislative amendments of 2012 increased the quota of seats in parliament allocated to women to 15 and the elections in 2013 witnessed an increase in the number of women in parliament to 18, 3 of whom won their seats outside the quota. The proportion of women in Parliament increased from 10.8 to 12 per cent. Consequently the proportion of women in senior positions also increased and three women currently occupy ministerial posts. There are 142 female judges comprising 15 per cent of the total in the country. The amended Municipalities Law of 2011 raised the quota allocated to women to 25 per cent of the members of municipal councils. In order to empower women economically and achieve equality in the workplace the Government reviewed and amended a range of economic legislation related to women, including the Social Security Law and also implemented laws obliging larger employers to provide childcare. 

13. 
The delegation affirmed that in combating torture the constitutional amendments of 2011 included the explicit prohibition of torture. Article 208 of the Penal Code criminalizes torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. Guidelines and manuals for investigating torture crimes and for pretrial detention have been prepared to help judges and prosecutors to register and prosecute cases of ill-treatment and to reduce pretrial detention. 

14. 
The delegation stated that public security personnel do not enjoy any kind of immunity from prosecution. Suspects are tried before the Police Court, which is independent and tries public security personnel. The amended Public Security Act provides for the inclusion of civilian judges in the police court in order to increase the appropriate guarantees for a fair trial. Grievance mechanisms are available for anyone who wishes to complain. Protection of the rights of the child will be increased through the draft child rights act and a national framework to combat child labour has been prepared to protect children from economic exploitation. Social care services have been improved through adopting quality assurance mechanisms. 

15. 
The delegation stated that in order to continue efforts to improve the living conditions of persons with disabilities, Jordan had taken many steps aimed at achieving this goal, including supporting their right to live independently, integration in the community and self-reliance. 

16. 
The delegation indicated that Jordan continued its cooperation and constructive dialogue with the treaty bodies and special procedures, including submitting its reports. 

17. 
With regard to the promotion of freedom of opinion and expression, in addition to the constitutional guarantees, the delegation noted that Jordan had enacted legislation that provided an enabling environment for freedom of expression and the free exchange of information as one of the pillars of its democratic transformation. It launched the national media strategy for the years 2011Ð2015, which aims to create an environment that supports independent media and establish the appropriate legal framework to ensure a balance between freedom and responsibility. The committee in charge of monitoring the implementation of the media strategy completed work on a number of pieces of legislation, such as the Press and Publications Law, Law on the Protection of State Secrets and Documents, Audiovisual law and Law on Access to Information.

The health, infrastructure and education systems are not capable of absorbing this large influx. Many schools have to use double shifts in order to include the refugee children. Jordan has only received approximately 30 to 40 per cent of the financial aid it needs in order to sustain the Syrian refugees.

A national monitoring team is in charge of detecting torture; it includes the National Human Rights Commission and NGOs. There are also standard training systems for prosecutors, investigators and law enforcement officers on how to investigate and report torture. The civil code provides general rules regarding compensation which victims of torture can use. Under the recent constitutional amendments, the jurisdiction of the State Security Court has been limited to cases of crimes of treason, espionage and terrorism, drug-related crimes and the counterfeiting of currency; in addition, following the recent constitutional amendments, civilians only appear before civilian judges.  

112. 
The delegation stated that the draft law on the rights of child is in the legislative process, however some members of civil society have asked for the draft to be withdrawn and requested a more rights-based and inclusive dialogue to discuss the law before its adoption and the Government has agreed to this request. The process of amending the draft law for protection against domestic violence has started with the aim of including provisions that strengthen protection of women, children and the family as a whole. The Government has also finalized the draft law on juveniles which is in compliance with international standards and ensures the protection and security of juveniles in detention centres and elsewhere. The Government has recently submitted plans to reform social 

provisions for the protection of vulnerable groups, including persons with disabilities. For social care institutions, the national team for monitoring and inspection is fully composed of civil society organizations for the best interests of the beneficiaries. 

113. 
The delegation stated that civil society organizations voiced comments regarding registration and financing under the Law on Associations and amendments have been made. The new provisions will be adopted, providing greater flexibility in access to finances.  

114. 
The delegation repeated earlier statistics on the success of empowering women in politics and also referred to its efforts to strengthen the economic rights of women. A recently adopted law on the pension rights of women will give them their own pension and that of a deceased husband. As for protection of women from sexual harassment in the work place, the Penal Code criminalizes sexual harassment. The Labour Law has additional sanctions for employers who commit sexual harassment. An employerÕs workplace will be closed down if a woman is subjected to sexual harassment by him. 

115. 
In conclusion, the delegation stated that Jordan took serious note of all the remarks and interventions. Everything raised in this review is appreciated by Jordan. 

116. 
In relation to the international human rights treaties, the delegation promised that Jordan will take all necessary measures to sign the International Convention for the Protection of all Persons from Enforced Disappearance.  

117.

Introduction 
1.

The review of Monaco was held at the 11th meeting on 28 October 2013. The delegation of Monaco was headed by JosŽ Badia, Minister of Foreign Affairs. At its 18th meeting, held on 31 October 2013, the Working Group adopted the report on Monaco. 

2. 
On 14 January 2013, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Monaco: Guatemala, the Philippines and Uganda.

I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
A. Presentation by the State under review 
5. 
At the 11th meeting of the Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, held on 28 October 2013, Mr. JosŽ Badia, Minister for Foreign Affairs, introduced the national report and made an opening statement in which he expressed gratitude for the opportunity to report on the progress made in the promotion and protection of human rights and the implementation of the recommendations made by the Human Rights Council in 2009. With regard to the preparations for the second universal periodic review, he emphasized the involvement of civil society and of the National Council (Parliament). 

6. 
He described some of the specific features of the Principality of Monaco: (a) it is an independent sovereign State that covers an area of only 2.02 square kilometres; (b) it is a hereditary constitutional monarchy that upholds the primacy of the law and ensures the separation of powers; (c) it is a country made up of only 36,000 inhabitants, of which about 8,600 have Monegasque nationality. 

7. 
He noted that the Principality was deeply committed to the promotion and protection of human rights, which constituted priorities in its national and international policy. Many of the laws it had adopted reflected that commitment, including (a) Act No 1.359 of 20 April 2009 on the establishment of an antenatal and family support coordination centre, amending article 248 of the Criminal Code and article 323 of the Civil Code; (b) Act No. 


1.387 of 19 December 2011 amending Act No. 1.155 on nationality; (c) Act No. 1.382 of 20 July 2011 on the prevention and punishment of specific forms of violence; and Act No. 
1.399 of 25 June 2013 instituting reforms of the Code of Criminal Procedure in respect of police custody. 
8. 
He indicated that draft legislation on video surveillance was being prepared, to take account of recommendations made by the Commissioner for Human Rights of the Council of Europe. 

9. 
Concerning the inheritance rights of children, he pointed out that Act. No. 1.278 of 29 December 2003, amending certain provisions of the Civil Code, the Code of Civil Procedure and the Commercial Code, had abolished any distinction in the inheritance rights of natural children, legitimate children and children born out of wedlock or of an incestuous relationship. 

10. 
With regard to harassment in the workplace, he recalled that Act No. 1.382, cited above, had resulted in the inclusion in the countryÕs criminal legislation of Criminal Code article 236-1, which made any harassment a criminal offence, and that on 18 December 2012, the Government of the Principality had submitted to the National Council Bill No. 908 on harassment and violence in the workplace. 

11. 
On the international level, in 2009, the Principality signed the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Bill No. 893 on the protection, autonomy and promotion of the rights and freedoms of persons with disabilities was submitted by the Government to the National Council on 7 December 2011 and was currently under study. The text had been drawn up with reference to the provisions of the Convention that the Principality was planning to ratify. 

12. 
Monaco had also signed the Council of Europe Convention on Preventing and Combating Violence against Women and Domestic Violence (Istanbul Convention) and the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime. The process of ratifying the latter convention was currently under way. 

13. 
The Principality had also ratified the Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees and the Convention against Discrimination in Education of the United Nations Education, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). 

14. 
Monaco was soon to ratify the Council of Europe Convention on the Protection of Children against Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse (the so-called Lanzarote Convention). The impact of possible accession to the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women was currently being studied. 

15. 
Following extensive consideration of the possibility of ratifying the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, the Government had identified the difficulties that would be involved in terms of concordance with institutions at the domestic level. Nevertheless, Monaco was determined to cooperate with the Court on a case-by-case basis in matters for which the Court requested its collaboration, as had already been the case in the past. 

16. 
The delegation of Monaco indicated that the Principality had established extraterritorial jurisdiction over cruel treatment, torture, mutilation, organ trafficking, rape and other forms of sexual violence. 

17. 
The head of the delegation noted that the Principality of Monaco had either set up or modernized the following institutions: (a) the antenatal and family support coordination centre; (b) the Princess Charlene ChildrenÕs Home (formerly the Sainte DŽvote home); and 


(c) the Rainier III Clinic Gerontology Centre. In early 2014, the office of High Commissioner for the protection of rights and freedoms and mediation had been established. 
18. 
In terms of raising public awareness about the struggle against discrimination, for several years the Department of National Education, Youth and Sports had been involved in a number of publicity campaigns. Prevention programmes were likewise taking part in the effort to combat any form of discrimination: for example, as part of their work to combat sexually transmitted infections, they dealt with the exclusion of persons living with AIDS. Every year Monaco celebrated International WomenÕs Day, the International Day of Persons with Disabilities and Universal ChildrenÕs Day. 

19. 
With regard to the participation of women in decision-making, the head of the delegation said that generally speaking, there were many women in senior posts in the Monegasque administration and in the judiciary. There was also a woman Minister for Public Works, the Environment and Urban Development. 

20. 
Concerning non-discrimination in employment, he said that rights in the field of employment were exercised without distinction, with the exception of rights related to nationality or place of residence, and there, it was a matter not of discrimination but of priorities specifically based on the limited number of citizens of Monaco, who constituted a minority in their own country. Regarding social security for workers, he emphasized that the relevant legislation and regulations created no distinctions among beneficiaries based on their nationality. 

21. 
With regard to disabilities, he noted that in 2006, the Principality of Monaco had appointed a delegate with responsibility for persons with disabilities. The Government had made significant efforts in recent years to facilitate access to public facilities, to the city and to public transport for persons with disabilities. 

22. 
Concerning domestic violence, he noted that Act No. 1.382 of 20 July 2011 on the prevention and punishment of specific forms of violence had been adopted for the very purpose of strengthening the protection of women, children and persons with disabilities. 

23. 
In education, he explained that courses in history and civics were based on the fundamental principles of human rights, education in which was compulsory in the Monegasque national curriculum. 

24. 
Despite the particularly difficult international context, the Government sought to maintain its commitment to international solidarity with the most disadvantaged groups (women, children, persons with disabilities) and those severely affected by conflict. 



B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review 
25. 
During the interactive dialogue, 40 delegations made statements. Recommendations made during the dialogue are to be found in section II of the present report. 

26. 
The Islamic Republic of Iran welcomed the statement of Monaco and expressed concern over a number of human rights violations, including the distinction between native and naturalized Monegasques, which introduced a form of discrimination regarding the rights associated with citizenship. It noted that Monegasque legislation had created various groups of foreigners with different rights and protection according to their nationality. It made recommendations. 

27.

46. 
With regard to international cooperation, the Minister for Foreign Affairs noted that the Government of Monaco sought to maintain its commitment to international solidarity with the most disadvantaged groups and those severely affected by conflict.

47. 
Aid from Monaco provided support for some 120 development cooperation projects every year. Assistance was also allocated to international organizations (health, protection of children, human rights, environmental protection and humanitarian emergency assistance). 

48. 
Concerning the criminalization of racist acts, he said that under Act No. 1.299 of 15 July 2005 on freedom of public expression, any racially motivated provocation, irrespective of the means used, was a criminal offence. The Government of the Principality had not ruled out the possibility of amending the Criminal Code to make racist motivation an aggravating circumstance. 

49. 
As to the ratification of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, the Principality of Monaco had already identified several structural problems, mostly constitutional. However, it had already responded favourably to requests from the Court for judicial assistance and cooperation. 

50. 
Responding to the question on defamation, he said that although it was specifically criminalized, that was not an obstacle to freedom of expression. The very purpose of its criminalization was to protect persons against defamation on account of membership in any given group. Freedom of expression had limits, and a balance must be found between freedom of expression and repression of clearly defamatory remarks. 

51. 
On the questions regarding persons with disabilities, Monaco stressed the importance of the policy designed to give priority to the autonomy and normal social integration of persons with disabilities.

No reports of acts of torture had been received recently in Monaco.  

54. 
Concerning what might appear to be discrimination in the workplace, he explained that the protection instituted for Monegasque nationals was justified by the unique nature of the Principality. The Constitution afforded priority to Monegasque citizens in access to public and private employment if they possessed the necessary aptitudes: when aptitudes were equal, then priority came into play. No preference was given on grounds of race, gender, colour, public opinions or social origin. The system made it possible to promote full employment of nationals without depriving non-nationals of the possibility of being hired. 

55. 
Social protection was based on the notion of workplace, and there was no discrimination. Monegasque wage earners and foreign wage earners who were regularly accorded work in the Principality enjoyed the same level of protection, irrespective of their nationality. 

56. 
The possibility of joining the International Labour Organization (ILO) had not been ruled out. The analysis in which Monaco was engaging was justified by the question of how the ILO principles could be reconciled with the Monegasque system of priority in employment and trade union rights. The same reasons had led the Government of the Principality to continue its study of the possibility of ratifying ILO Convention No. 11 (1958) concerning Discrimination in Respect of Employment and Occupation. 

57. 
The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland recognized that human rights were enshrined in the Constitution and noted the fair treatment of prisoners, which was monitored by independent observers.

58.

66.

80.

85.

86. 
He indicated that Wages Act No. 739 of 16 March 1963 guaranteed gender equality in remuneration and rendered null and void any regulation that discriminated between men and women in terms of remuneration. The only discrimination that existed was positive discrimination, in the sense that there were legislative provisions that offered enhanced protection to women and young people. 

87. 
There was no differentiation in the Principality of Monaco among Monegasque wage earners; the rules for employers and employees were applicable to all employers and all employees without distinction as to race, religion, nationality, colour or gender.

Introduction 
1. 
The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, established in accordance with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its eighteenth session from 27 January to 7 February 2014. The review of Afghanistan was held at the 2nd meeting, on 27 January 2014. The delegation of Afghanistan was headed by Mohammad Qasim Hashemzai, Senior Advisor, Ministry of Justice. At its 10th meeting, held on 31 January 2014, the Working Group adopted the report on Afghanistan. 

2. 
On 15 January 2014, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Afghanistan: Benin, Estonia and the United Arab Emirates. 

3. 
In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1 and paragraph 5 of the annex to resolution 16/21, the following documents were issued for the review of Afghanistan: 


(a) 
A national report submitted/written presentation made in accordance with paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/18/AFG/1 and Corr.1);

A compilation prepared by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) (A/HRC/WG.6/18/AFG/2); 

(c) 
A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) (A/HRC/WG.6/18/AFG/3 and Corr.1). 


4. A list of questions prepared in advance by Belgium, Canada, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, Liechtenstein, Mexico, Netherlands, Norway, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States of America was transmitted to Afghanistan through the troika. Those questions are available on the extranet of the universal periodic review (UPR). 
I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
A. Presentation by the State under review 
5. 
The head of the delegation affirmed the commitment of Afghanistan to the promotion and the protection of human rights, in particular womenÕs and childrenÕs rights. That commitment was evident at the national level in the provisions of the Constitution and various laws, and in policies and plans that had been enacted in accordance with the Constitution and international obligations. The Government had taken major steps to pragmatically implement human rights conventions and to prepare and present national reports on the status of their implementation. 

6. 
Afghanistan had gone through the first UPR cycle in May 2009, and received 143 recommendations. At that time, Afghanistan had declared its support for most of those recommendations; only 10 did not enjoy its support. It had taken the recommendations seriously, undertaking a number of initiatives in various ministries and institutions in Afghanistan. To prepare the report for the second UPR cycle, the Government had established a national process, whereby civil society and human rights institutions had been involved in the process of data collection and report analysis. The report had been prepared on the basis of a plan of action the Government had created in 2012 for follow-up to the recommendations. 

7. 
The Government had actively promoted and protected civil and political rights in Afghanistan. Afghanistan was a good example in the region with respect to promoting freedom of speech, freedom of the media and freedom of associations without censorship. 

8. 
The President of Afghanistan constantly met with representatives of national and international media, human rights activists and womenÕs rights defenders. The High Council of Media, composed of representatives of civil society, media groups and the Ministry of Information and Culture, was working to protect the rights and activities of the media and journalists. 

9. 
Afghanistan was currently preparing for the presidential and provincial council elections. The Government had invited international observers to monitor the process of fair and free elections. According to the Independent Election Commission, in 2013 3,305,799 citizens, 1,140,854 of whom were women, had received voting cards to participate in the elections. Human rights organizations and civil society activists would closely monitor the upcoming elections. The political opposition groups freely organized their political programmes without any intervention from the Government. There were 59 registered political parties in Afghanistan. 

10. 
Afghan citizens had access to health care, education, employment and trade unions. 

11. 
The Constitution guaranteed education as a right of all citizens; education was provided free of charge and in native languages up to the bachelorÕs degree level . 

12. 
Owing to efforts made by Afghanistan to improve the quality and quantity of education, the following progress had been made between 2009 and 2013: 

¥ 
Schools had been constructed, increasing the total number from 11,460 schools in 2009 to 15,169 in 2013; of those, 2,267 were allocated to girls 

¥ 
The number of students had increased from 6,504,715 in 2009 to 8,643,940 in 2013; of those, 3,353,991 were female 

¥ 
A total of 135 million books had been printed between 2009 and 2013, at a cost of US$ 90 million 

¥ 
The number of students enrolled in vocational schools had increased from 18,296 in 2009 to 71,625 in 2013; 11 per cent of those were female 

¥ 
The number of training centres for literacy had increased from 20,031 in 2009 to 26,486 in 2013, providing courses to 563,460 students 

¥ 
Total enrolment in higher education had increased from 52,000 in 2009 to 220,000 in 2013 



13. 
In accordance with the Constitution, the Government was obliged to provide free health services for all Afghan citizens without any discrimination. 

14. 
With respect to health services, various policies and strategies had been developed. Of particular note were: the public health programme entitled ÒHealth for all AfghansÓ, covering the period 2012Ð2020; the System Enhancement for Health Action in Transition project, aimed at supporting health-care provision for the period 2013Ð2018; the Health and Human Rights Strategy and the Gender Strategy; and the Health Financing Policy 2012Ð 2020. 

15. 
Recent data indicated that substantial improvements had been made in the health.care sector. For example, the maternal mortality ratio had dropped from 1,600 to 327 deaths per 100,000 live births, the under-five mortality rate had been reduced from 257 to 97 deaths per 1,000 live births and the infant mortality rate had decreased from 129 to 77 

deaths per 1,000 live births. About 46 per cent of infants had received the measles vaccination and the rate of polio vaccination had increased from 50 to 95 per cent. 

16. 
The main challenge, however, was the lack of security in some of the remote areas of Afghanistan. Terrorist groups targeted schools, hospitals and other public-service institutions. Teachers, health workers, women activists and childcare staff were considered to be the most targeted groups. 

17. 
The Government continued the process of legal reform in the light of the international conventions that Afghanistan had ratified. The Government had reviewed 73 laws, 34 regulations and 27 strategies, including the Civil Code, the Penal Code, the Juvenile Code, the Elimination of Violence against Women Law and the Citizenship Law. 

18. 
WomenÕs rights and gender equality remained a top priority for the Government. Afghan women constituted 27 per cent of legislators in the Parliament. Women occupied 25 per cent of government jobs, including 9 per cent of those at decision-making levels. Girls currently represented about 40 per cent of the nearly 9 million children attending school in Afghanistan. About 30 per cent of the school teachers and 15 per cent of the university lecturers were women. In terms of the workforce in other areas, Afghan women constituted 24 per cent in the health-care sector, 5 per cent in security and 30 per cent in agriculture. Women also accounted for 20 per cent of the enrolment in higher education and 35 per cent of the participants in vocational training. Women represent at least 50 per cent of those working in the countryÕs independent media and civil society groups. 

19. 
In addition to fostering greater participation of women in the above-mentioned sectors, the Government had adopted various measures for the protection of women and the prevention of violence against them in the previous four years. Of particular note were: (a) the adoption of the Elimination of Violence against Women Law; (b) the establishment of special prosecution offices for cases of violence against women; (c) the establishment of the High Commission for Prevention of Violence against Women and provincial offices thereof in 23 provinces; (d) the establishment of 16 protection centres/shelters for women victims of family violence; (e) the establishment of departments of womenÕs affairs in 32 provinces; (f) the establishment of gender units in 22 ministries; and (g) the establishment of a gender and human rights unit within the police academy. 

20. 
The Government was developing a national plan of action on women, peace and security for beyond 2014, with a view to adopting additional measures to increase the participation of women, to prevent violence against women and to provide relief and recovery services. 

21. 
The Government had adopted appropriate measures to ensure that children were protected against all forms of discrimination or punishment on the basis of the legislative provisions of the Labour Law, the Juvenile Code and the human trafficking law and of the policy provisions and activities under, inter alia, the National Strategy for Children at Risk and the national plan of action on children in armed conflict. Afghanistan had also received from the United Nations a 15-point road map on further implementation of the national plan of action on children in armed conflict that the Government intended to approve and implement. 

22. 
The Government continued to stand firm in fighting corruption. Several measures, including the adoption of the Anti-Corruption Law and the establishment of civil and military anti-corruption prosecution units and tribunals, had been taken. 

23. 
The Constitution prohibited torture and inhuman, humiliating and cruel punishment under all circumstances. In order to track torture-related cases, human rights units and supervisory boards had been established in the Ministry of the Interior, the National Directorate of Security and the Ministry of Defence. The second report of Afghanistan 

under the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT) was being prepared and would be submitted in September 2014. 

24. 
Afghanistan still faced a number of challenges, relating to terrorism, extremism, narcotics and insecurity in some parts of the country, that had slowed progress in the area of human rights and the implementation of transitional justice. 

25. 
Poverty and corruption had made it difficult to tackle those challenges. The scarcity of resources to finance a nationwide welfare programme was another challenge. 

26. 
Afghanistan was a war-torn country that had achieved enormous gains and successes in the previous 12 years in various areas, including human rights; those achievements had been won in the face of exceptionally tough conditions and ongoing challenges. 

27. 
Afghanistan was strongly determined to take effective measures to strengthen its capabilities, in collaboration with the international community. 

28. 
The head of the delegation concluded his introductory remarks by stating that the implementation of programmes and reforms aimed at promoting and protecting human rights in Afghanistan required the cooperation and participation of all governmental bodies and civil society, as well as direct cooperation and support from the international community, in particular international organizations active in the area of human rights. He expressed hope that Afghanistan would gradually witness greater improvements in human rights.

At its 13th meeting held on 30 April 2013, the Working Group adopted the report on Djibouti. 

2. 
On 14 January 2013, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Djibouti: Burkina Faso, Qatar and the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. 

3.

4. A list of questions prepared in advance by Lichtenstein, Mexico, Montenegro, the Netherlands, Slovenia, Spain and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland was transmitted to Djibouti through the troika. These questions are available on the extranet of the universal periodic review (UPR). 
I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
A. Presentation by the State under review 
5. 
The head of the delegation of Djibouti, the Minister of Justice, said that Djibouti had become a party to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the Optional Protocol thereto in 2010. It had also ratified the two optional protocols to the Convention on the Rights of the Child, and the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. 

6. 
Since 2009, Djibouti had submitted a large number of reports to treaty bodies, including the core document in 2010,1 the report on the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment in 2010,2 the report on the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women,3 the report on the implementation of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural 


1 HRI/CORE/DJI/2010. 
2 CAT/C/DJI/1. 
3 CEDAW/C/DJI/1-3. 
Rights in 2010,4 and the report on the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights in 2012.5 
7. 
A three-pronged cooperation programme had been launched, comprising capacity-building for the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) and civil society; social mobilization for human rights, targeting both the general public and law enforcement officials such as the judiciary, the police, the gendarmerie and prison guards; and measures to clear the backlog in the submission of reports. 

8. 
In 2010, the Constitution had been revised to abolish capital punishment. The practice of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment was also prohibited by the Constitution. 

9. 
Training courses were conducted for law enforcement officials on the rights and freedoms of persons taken in for questioning or detained, and article 330 of the Criminal Code provided for more severe punishment of officials found guilty of committing acts of torture. 

10. 
Regarding access to justice, recruitment of magistrates had doubled since 2009. In 2012, pursuant to legal aid reform legislation, a service providing counsel at all stages of the proceedings, and a unit for reception and guidance for those involved in proceedings, had been set up. 

11. 
In 2011, the Government had launched the innovative Òmobile courtÓ programme, whereby judges and courts came to communities where none existed. Concerning the communications sector, new regulations governing print and audiovisual media journalists, Act No. 187/AN/07/5 on the Status of Press and Audiovisual Media Staff (March 2007), had been promulgated by the Head of State in May 2007. 

12. 
Djibouti had journalistsÕ trade unions and associations mandated to promote freedom of expression at the national, regional and international levels. They networked with the Federation of African Journalists (FAJ) and the Eastern Africa Journalists Association. 

13. 
The Minister of Communications, responsible for postal and telecommunication services, had implemented a training and information programme on freedom of expression together with the East Africa Regional Office of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) and the National Human Rights Commission. 

14. 
Two projects would be launched to set up regulatory bodies, namely a national commission on communications and a national commission responsible for issuing press cards. 

15. 
In the political realm, the Government had recently made important headway through the adoption of an organic Act which partially amended the 1992 Organic Act on Elections. 

16. 
The Ministry of Health had conducted a series of activities to reduce maternal and neonatal mortality, including by increasing antenatal and postnatal checkups, which had helped reduce the number of hospital deaths. Antenatal care coverage had increased from 


63.60 to 87.27 per cent. Likewise, maternal mortality had fallen from 546 per 100,000 live births in 2002 to 300 per 100,000 live births in 2011. 
4 E/C.12/DJI/1-2. 5 CCPR/C/DJI/1. 
17. 
Infant and under-5 mortality rates, which had stood at 67 and 94 per 1,000 live births in 2006, had declined. For 2012, the outcome of the current survey on the subject was awaited. 

18. 
Regional hospitals had been built and others were planned. 

19. 
The number of Ministry of Health staff was increasing steadily, and had risen from 509 in 1999 to 2,353 in 2012. The health budget currently accounted for 14 per cent of the total State budget, health thus representing a significant portion of the national budget. 

20. 
Concerning the right to education, the education policy 2010Ð2019 had made the quality of education a central concern of the 10-year strategy. 

21. 
In the area of governance and sustainable development, Djibouti was currently in the process of redrafting anti-corruption legislation, with the support of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC). In connection with that reform, Djibouti was under review and reviewing at the same time. 

22. 
Djibouti was also engaged in comprehensive civil service reform to make it more efficient. 

23. 
Following the statement made by the head of the delegation, the Minister for the Advancement of Women said that Djibouti had a national gender policy for the period 2011Ð2021, which had been enacted as legislation.
