    "# Basic machine learning workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "Refer back to **4-2_Machine-Learning-Review.pdf** to review your key terms. Below is a simplified workflow:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Do you want to predict something? \n",
    "    - Yes = supervised learning (y ~ X)\n",
    "    - No = unsupervised learning (~ X)\n",
    "2. If supervised:\n",
    "    - Syntax looks like this: **y ~ X** ([use x to predict y](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/207425/why-do-we-say-the-outcome-variable-is-regressed-on-the-predictors)), or \"regress y on X\".\n",
    "    - **y** is the thing we want to predict! (dependent/target/outcome variable)\n",
    "    - **x** is the thing(s) we use to do the predicting (independent/predictor/input variable)\n",
    "3. If supervised:\n",
    "    - perform **regression** if the **y** variable is continuous\n",
    "    - perform **classification** if the **y** variable is discrete/categorical\n",
    "4. If unsupervised: \n",
    "    - Syntax looks like this: **~ X**\n",
    "    - We only have **X** variables, and we want to see how they sort on their own accord without trying to predict anything.\n",
    "5. Handle missing data\n",
    "    - Missing data should be handled somehow. [Listwise deletion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Listwise_deletion) is common but not preferred because of the amount of information that is lost. [Mean imputation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imputation_(statistics)#Mean_substitution) is also used but is sensitive to outliers. [Median imputation](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/143700/which-is-better-replacement-by-mean-and-replacement-by-median) is often reliable and interpretable. [Generalized low rank models](https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/papers/pdf/glrm.pdf) are preferred! \n",
    "6. Convert categorical variables to indicators\n",
    "    - Use [one-hot encoding](https://hackernoon.com/what-is-one-hot-encoding-why-and-when-do-you-have-to-use-it-e3c6186d008f) to your advantage! Most supervised algorithms handle factor/categorical data poorly (decision trees being a main exception). \n",
    "7. Split the data\n",
    "    - [Split the original dataset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training,_validation,_and_test_sets) so that (arbitrarily) 70% is assigned to the **training set** and the remaining 30% to the **test set**. \n",
    "        - Use [random sampling]() if you are splitting continuous data. \n",
    "        - Use [stratified](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratified_sampling) [sampling](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/032615/what-are-some-examples-stratified-random-sampling.asp#:~:text=Stratified%20random%20sampling%20divides%20a,of%20the%20groups%20or%20strata.&text=Stratified%20random%20sampling%20is%20a%20method%20of%20sampling%2C%20which%20is,a%20sample%20size%20for%20study.) if you are splitting categorical data. \n",
    "    - [Data splitting](https://www.mff.cuni.cz/veda/konference/wds/proc/pdf10/WDS10_105_i1_Reitermanova.pdf) is a fundamental preprocessing step! \n",
    "    - [Cross-validation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-validation_(statistics)) is even better because it repeats this splitting _k_ number of times.\n",
    "8. Fit the model to the training set and evaluate its performance. \n",
    "    - Fit the data to the training set so it can \"learn\" the relationships between the **X and y** variables. \n",
    "    - Then use a [performance](https://towardsdatascience.com/20-popular-machine-learning-metrics-part-1-classification-regression-evaluation-metrics-1ca3e282a2ce) [metric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation_of_binary_classifiers) to see how well the model fit the data. \n",
    "    - What is a [loss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_functions_for_classification) [function](https://medium.com/@phuctrt/loss-functions-why-what-where-or-when-189815343d3f)?\n",
    "    - The model is **underfit** if the model performs poorly on the training dataset. \n",
    "9. Fit the data to the test set and evaluate its performance\n",
    "    - See how well the model performs on the test set; hopefully we see roughly similar performances for the training and test sets. \n",
    "    - The model is **overfit** if the model performs poorly on the training dataset but poorly on the test dataset. "
