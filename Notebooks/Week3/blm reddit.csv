Nazis are kinda the unsubtle, undersexed/overugly and viciously cruel ‘Sadist brainiac’ element that generally brings about military or civil intervention, thank God, but Fascists are often Hot, Smart, and Very Well Funded.  And they like idiots like this getting hosed down cause it helps their cause in a way: if everyone thinks that Stupidity and Ugliness is inherent to All totalitarians appearance then they have greater carte blanche to hide in plain sight.  Think Rupert Murdochs hot asian slampiece.  Ugly? No.  A Fascist sellout? Absolutely!  That Ryan Gosling flick the Believer is a decent example of how nefarious and alluring Fascists can act up front before they set their pawns in motion.

They are hoping a praying that a race war breaks out.  Divide and conquer 101.  And if some sort of armed revolt were to happen it would play directly in thier hand and they would be able to respond with true force and allow the police to gain more power.  

This is just another way they are keeping the common man down and at the same time centralizing power.

If we could all unite despite color or creed the ones causing all the flaws in our society would be in big trouble, and they know this. They also know people are starting to pay attention more to things like the corrupt and defunct healthcare system, so they subliminally ignite racial tension."

Systemic racism, oppression, and terror isn't adminstration dependent. This is the system working as it's designed. Every executive administration has enforced the same oppression, they've just had different tools at their disposal.

Pay out ur ass or lose ur license then lose ur job and go bankrupt.  They shit on us over and over and charge crazy money for any little thing they possibly can.  

Meanwhile the common people are working people, they work hard for every little damn thing they have.  They work thier bodies to the bone, breaking thier backs and joints for some cold corporate scum that cares nothing for thier well being just the bottom line.  The working class trades all the time of thier life in exchange for just barely enough for them and thier family to survive.   We spend our lives doing menial work away from our loved ones.  We get one life to live and we spend the whole thing doing something we dont even want to do....it is tragic.  

Our enemy has a 2,000 year head start, as the elites have had thier position of power established since the beginning of complex civilization.  

I see a future where every man, woman, and child has a purpose and a home.  Where everybody is given an equal share.  Where we have no need for such base things like money, because we are advanced and are aware of exactly how much resources we have and how to distribute them equally amongst ourselves.  A future where there are no borders.  No elites, no class system, and no warfare.  A future where mankind has a completely symbiotic relationship with the planet, one in which we make nature better and nature makes us better.  A world where every human is working together to explore the stars and seed other planets with human life.  To go out and find other intelligence life and better ourselves and them.  A future of positivity, not like the hate, fear, and negativity we currently have.

Our enemy is against this future.  They will do anything to uphold the status quo in trade for some instant gratification.  They dont care about improving mans lot in the universe because they are sociopaths that lack empathy and only care about what they can take from you.

264,1,"I agree about the racial divide shit, but what do you consider ""their fair share?""

I ask because there is much talk of taking from the rich and I haven't completely been sold on this idea. I am not poor, I am not rich. I think I would be considered lower middle class. Lower, lower, if there is such a thing. I lost my job in April due the whole covid crap. Now I have an opportunity to get in to what would be considered upper middle class. Maybe even upper, upper middle class. There's no guarantee though and I will have to seriously bust my ass to get there. It is not a unique job, doesn't require any special education and is probably something almost anyone can do. I saw the difference in my net and gross pay before because of taxes so I can only imagine what it will be like if I am able to get myself up there. 

When I hear things like what you said, it makes me wonder why I should bust my ass if I'm going to have to turn over what I've worked hard for to people that really could have done the same thing I'm doing? What makes others entitled to demand I hand over ""their fair share"" of what I busted my ass to get?"

But thanks for trying, I guess."
268,2,When they get caught they get prosecuted. Pigs get away with it. Big difference
269,12,"It depends what type of gun and in what state it’s carried. 

For example most revolvers have the option of being fired “double action” - that is, pulling the trigger both cocks the hammer AND releases it to strike the round. These are normally carried with a round in the chamber, but uncocked. 

Due to the trigger pull having to do two separate actions, it’s a heavy pull - hard to do accidentally, so double-action revolvers rarely need a dedicated safety. 

Other revolvers are “single-action” (getting rarer these days). In these, the revolver must be cocked, THEN fired. In these you have the option of either carrying cocked, with a manual safety, OR carrying uncocked, in which case you don’t need a safety. 

It’s a similar logic with many autoloaders. Autoloaders are typically carried with a round in the chamber, and with EITHER a manual safety, OR an internal hammer decocked or at half-cock, to lengthen the trigger pull so you don’t need a safety. 

Some people prefer to carry with an empty chamber, in which case a safety catch is completely unnecessary as it’s basically impossible to rack the slide of an autoloader by accident.  

Many guns (especially autoloaders) have “grip safeties” built into the grip (no kidding) so if your hand isn’t pressing them, the trigger is disconnected. Meaning if the trigger snags on something in the holster etc, it won’t go off. 

Finally, no safety catch is as effective as learning and performing correct trigger discipline, and following the other rules of gun safety, the most important being: 

All guns are always loaded, ESPECIALLY when you know they aren’t loaded, and

Never point a gun at anything you don’t wish to destroy, and wouldn’t be comfortable to admitting killing in court. 

Hope this helps. Sure I missed something, but there you go. 

Oh also, in some jurisdictions and/or professions, limitations on how you can carry may exist, for example not being able to carry with a round in the chamber."
270,1,"A lot modern handguns like Sigs or Glocs lack manual safeties for a lot of reasons, but mostly because they are antiquated and also because of what was mentioned above with ""life or death"" situations. 

They are antiquated because we have progressed handgun technology to the point where the amount of extra safety you would get is a diminishing return (with proper trigger discipline) and the safety would just get in the way when you need to fire. The main reason for safeties on auto-loading handguns historically was actually to prevent things like the gun firing while racking the slide (slam fire), or when the gun is dropped (although negligent trigger pull was a major reason, it wasn't the main reason). For example, Glocks and other modern handguns without safeties have something called a ""firing pin block"". This part of the handgun makes it virtually impossible for a handgun to fire from being dropped or slammed, because the firing pin will have nowhere to go. Also, Glocks/Sigs nowadays have triggers that are much harder to pull than traditional handguns, significantly reducing the chance that the trigger gets bumped and the gun goes off. It's extremely unlikely that any Glock would fire while in a holster. 

I hope this clears things up and also that it was educational. 

Source: I have owned firearms for most of my life, I build my own custom handguns (which is federally legal, check your local laws), and my stepfather is an FFL licensed firearm manufacturer and I learned what I know from him.

Edit: Also, make sure you know your firearm well, especially how to safely operate it and whether or not it has a firing pin block."
271,1,There are guns made with various safety features. If you look up a security 9 look at the trigger. That particular gun is “drop safe” but it also has a manual safety. A 1911 has a few safety features one is on the back side of the grip.
272,1,My glock does not. And most home owners that use guns for said protection don’t work on drawing on a person and taking safety off. You need to practice holster to firing positions. And that includes taking safety off. And people don’t practice that and in stressful situations they fuck up
273,1,"On many handguns you can buy either the manual safety version, or the one without (to answer your question that's no alternative, just nothing). California and some other states require manual safeties, so a fair amount of guns  come in both flavors.  


That being said, handguns without safeties certainly seem to be more popular. Most handgun owners believe they don't need a safety. They say, ""The only safety they need is between their ears."" They believe that being able to draw and shoot quickly is more important than having an extra safety device.   


And besides manual safeties, handguns do have other kinds of safeties in them to help prevent accidents and negligent discharge. For example, most (if not all) modern handguns are drop safe. That is, they will not shoot if dropped (contrary to what movies would have you believe). Also, many handguns have trigger safeties that make it much harder for a trigger to activate if it is caught on a stick or some clothing. It requires the full even pressure of a finger to activate. Revolvers also have a safety that prevents their hammer from contacting the primer and shooting the gun, even if the hammer is hit forcefully from behind (old guns did not have this and you had to carry with one chamber empty to be safe)."
274,10,"Well, the decision to remove manual safties is due to the fact that in a compromising position aka shit hits the fan and you have to pull your gun, a manual safety is another road block that can potentially get you killed in a combat situation. The guy in the video knows his shit. Trigger discipline is amazing. Not once does his finger veer near that trigger. The gun is always pointed in a safe direction. Up or down. He has to be a veteran. Regardless of the position on safeties. Training takes priority. He definitely has that."
275,2,"Look up what a striker fired handgun is and understand the mechanism, then do some research on what the three safeties are on a Glock. These are the trigger safety, firing pin safety, and the drop safety. Glock is a popular brand of striker fired handgun, but many other manufactures make them as well. These negate the need for a traditional manual safety, meaning one that is physically switched on or off. The benefit is in a life or death scenario there is one less thing to go wrong, whether that be via mechanical or user error. I would post links but I don’t know if they’re allowed here. Anyone who sees this can DM me if they’d like more info with sources on this."
276,2,"A mechanical gun safety is more of a last measure safety feature.


Keeping a finger off the trigger is the most effective safety feature, and mechanical safety's can fail when you need them the most.

While I'm not against safety's I am against the mentality ""all guns should"". Certain ""common sense"" features, such as a loaded chamber indicator, can add a sense of security that encourages people to pay less attention to safety rules. In the case of a loaded chamber indicator these features can actually be dangerous in life or death situations.

> Class requirements (again same as we have with our vehicles) for gun safety and use. (Yes, I realize that guns all differ on aspects, but overall there are similarities to reach about.)

Why? Driving on public roads is not a right. Owning a gun is a natural right? Especially since we have over 400 millions firearms and less that 0.01 percent are used in crime or self-harm. I'd say an overwhelmingly, gun owners are very responsible at owning guns. Maybe we should bring back gun clubs and classes at public schools and make the class for them mandatory as part of our Civics studies."

I do get that. I guess I’m personally not prepared for what escalation might bring, so I’m really torn. 

Edit: to be a little more explicit, the cops have dropped bombs on neighborhoods before, and I’m sure they’re itching for a reason to do it again. We shouldn’t have to live in fear, and for many 2A is the answer to that. But we cannot fight a literal war against cops who are more armed that most militaries"
320,2,"> I more take issue with pseudo-woke (usually wealthy, white) democrats who are too privileged to appreciate the relevance of the 2A. They aren't someone like you making a choice not to be around guns. Guys like Bloomberg don't carry themselves, but then they pay 5 men who are armed to accompany them at all times while they work to deny everyone else that same safety and security.

Whenever I hear people like that talk about gun control, the image that pops into my head is a half dozen of them at a banquet whispering to each other; ""You don't want to see a Black man walking around with an AK-47 do you?"""
321,9,"Honestly, it doesn't even need to be about a fight, and I don't even like going down that road in reddit discussions, because lots of cosplaying Boogaloo Bois crawl out of the woodwork. 

Rifles let you resist, and they ensure that your non-violent protest isn't extinguished. Consider how police are treating the righteous, peaceful BLM protests compared to the GRAVY Seals protesting the pandemic.

 Another recent example of wrong people using the right methods was Cliven Bundy and his ranchers were a perfect illustration of how cameras + internet + armed folks willing to take a stand = successful resistance."
322,7,"The whole point of the 2A is to be able to fight against tyranny and the only reason the government is more armed than us is because every gun law is an infringement on your Second Amendment Rights. “Nobody needs a fully automatic weapon”, “nobody needs more than 10 rounds in a magazine”, etc. besides the Government of course because they need to have the power OVER the people. And to your last point of you can’t fight a literal war with them then what was Vietnam? Mostly rice farmers with old AK’s beat a force with trillions of dollars."

The reality surrounding the idea of banning automatic, semi-automatic and other lethal weapons is the same as the reality surrounding right wing ideals maintaining criminalization of drugs and their attempts to criminalize abortion. Making something illegal, doesn't make it impossible to obtain. It just makes it more difficult to obtain, and creates criminals out of otherwise law abiding citizens."

Let's ignore the fact that this would never pass; from a simple logistics standpoint there is little chance you would actually get most people to voluntarily turn in these weapons.

The suggestion of it usually demonstrates a fundamental lack of knowledge of firearms in general. 

I'll leave you with this: what do you do about the ones out there now? I have a pistol from the late 1800s that still shoots just fine. Ammo in a sealed container lasts basically forever.

(also look at these hogs with guns, do you really want your side to not have any?) however i agree that there needs to be strict regulations and systems put into place for ensuring criminals and mentally unstable individuals from getting them. i also feel as though we need some kind of comprehensive education/training to all people that choose to own a weapon."

Firearms will never be an issue of the firearm in and of itself allowing someone to exert power in a way others disagree with. The problem is the human condition. The tool is irrelevant. If a human being seeks to cause harm, they will figure out a way to do it.

397,286,"Not being an outright racist isn't hard, but getting over more subtle, internal racial biases can be, and so can really understanding the historical *and* current racial struggles of Black and Indigenous people.

I'm a white guy that used to be somewhat anti-BLM around 2016, so I can provide some perspective. Basically, our education system and media networks whitewash *the fuck* out of our country's history.

I was led to believe that after the Civil Rights Movement has ended, equality was fully achieved for everyone and that any inequalities were small and mere coincidences since, *on paper*, everyone had equal rights.

Schools don't teach you things like redlining, race riots, genocides, horrific imperialism, COINTELPRO, and how historical continuity works in regards to how oppression and its impacts don't just end overnight and that oppression can exist without it being explicitly written into law. 

You only learn about that stuff by doing your own research and contemplating over history on your own, which took me a couple of years.

I was an early teen when I learned about BLM, so it was actually easier for me to come to accept the truth about this country since I hadn't fully internalized the pro-US propaganda in our schools and media.

I imagine that it's a decent bit harder for adults, especially older ones, who would have been fed *nothing* but whitewashed propaganda while they were developing as a person."
398,36,">Why can’t more people take this step?

Nice choice of words"
399,6,I struggled with this for a while. I can’t really explain it. I grew up around people that said stuff like “if they would have complied they’d still be alive”. And in many cases that may have been true. The part they always left out was “not complying doesn’t mean they should kill you”. I understand that now. I live in a really small town that I never would have imagined in a million years would have held a BLM march. But a few months ago we did. And their were hundreds of people there. I’m proud of my little (95% white) town. We’re all learning hopefully.
400,2,"Not supporting racism is *really* hard. Maybe having active and chronic hatred is something easy to get rid of, but supporting or even being neutral to the police, most government officials, cultural ideas, media and even jokes is supporting racism.

401,1,"A lot of people in these communities aren’t racist, they just only see right wing propaganda all day every day. 

They’re racist by association. All it takes is being exposed to different world views and racism fades away."
402,1,Not being racist means accepting truths about the nature of reality and human life that they are not willing to accept. Racist psychology is more complex than people give it credit for. It's to do with fear of being seen through the eyes of another.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elaine\_massacre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elaine_massacre)

I want to get this out of my system so bear with me.

It took me a while to grow and accept BLM. I vividly remember Zimmerman and how he murdered Trayvon Martin, which I thought then and still think that Zimmerman is guilty. I remember Ferguson and Michael Brown and that's when the All Lives Matter came in. I thought the shooting was awful but I'll admit, I supported ALM because honestly as I look back, I was oblivious to the pain of African Americans. Yes I supported Trump in 2016 citing that reasoning that ""Democrats were the true racists and the Republicans gave African Americans the 13th, 14th And 15th Amendments."" I still have the Trump sign that I got from the local Republican Headquarters as a reminder of my mistake.

By the end of 2017, I realized my mistake when Charlottesville happened and how Trump hesitated to officially condemn the KKK. I might had supported All Lives Matter but even I knew that you don't ever hesitate calling out the KKK for racist bullshit. That's when I decided to reevaluate myself and my positions. It took a while but almost all of my positions changed, Gay Marriage, LGBTQ+ Rights, Feminism, and for the sake of this post, BLM.

I know that as a white man from the south, I'll never be able to 100% comprehend what it means to be an African American in this country. I will never understand the pain, the anger and the helplessness that African Americans feel and have felt on a daily basis. All I can say is this.

We are standing at the crossroads of history in the midst of the younger generations version of the Civil Rights Movement. I will not sit back and not do anything at this pivotal time. I will do everything in my power to contribute to changing this society.

edit: thank you for the award.

edit 2: As a white Arkansan, I feel that its my civic duty to warn anyone who supports BLM, any minority in general, especially if they are African American to avoid Harrison, Arkansas and in essence, the entirety of Boone County. It's pretty much a sundown town in an unofficial sundown county and is ground zero for the KKK. It might look nice but its a ruse. There is a reason why Harrison is constantly labelled as the most racist town in America.

The past 6 months has made me go back and re-evaluate and question everything.  The big catalyst was the interview with Michael Holding (Whispering Death) who is my idol regarding my upbringing with cricket.  He is very articulate and measured man but highlighted some of these things he suffered in his life and also the things that children and adults are taught.
