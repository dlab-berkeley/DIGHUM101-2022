    "\n",
    "# Ethical web scraping\n",
    "Before choosing to engage in web scraping, you always have to consider some things:\n",
    "1. Many websites have a Terms of Use which may not allow scraping. We must respect websites that do not want to be scraped.\n",
    "2. Is there an API available already? If so, there's no need for us to write a scraper. APIs are created to provide access to data in a controlled way as defined by the owners of the data, so we prefer to use APIs if they're available.\n",
    "3. Making requests to a website can cause a toll on a website's performance. A web scraper that makes too many requests can be as debilitating. We must scrape responsibly so we won't cause any disruption to the regular functioning of the website.\n",

    "If you have doubts about the ethics of scraping some website, please consult with me.\n",

    "For web scraping we're going to need two libraries: [requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/) and [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/). BeautifulSoup is what we use to actually navigate and parse the page that we're scraping. We'll import the `time` library too. This will allow us to `time.sleep(5)` so that we don't overload anyone's servers. \n",
