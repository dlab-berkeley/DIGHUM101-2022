    "As you will see, programming is a creative process â€“ if Jupyter Notebooks are your canvas, Python is your brush. Here are some basic terms you will encounter often in this process:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data types** are categories of data items. Programming languages contain different kinds of data that tells what operations can performed on them. Examples are integers, strings, Booleans, etc. Notebook 1-4 will be all about data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../../Img/Python-data-structure.jpeg\" alt=\"data_types\" width=\"500\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Variables** are names attached to particular objects. To create a variable, you just assign it a value and then start using it. Assignment is done with a single equals sign (=): `n = 300`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Statements** are instructions that a Python interpreter can execute. They end with a NEWLINE character. That means each line in Python is a statement. For instance, `print('Hello')` is a statement; `x = 20` is a statement; `print(x)` is a statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Functions** perform actions on things. `print()` is one of the most familiar. You can often identify a function because of its trailing round parentheses.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Arguments** are the \"things\" we perform the action on. They can be values, mathematical expressions, text, variables, datasets, or even other functions! Arguments go inside the trailing parentheses of functions when we call them. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Methods** are type-specific functions. Different data types and structures have functions that only apply to that type/structure (i.e., floating-point numbers aka decimals, integers, strings, lists, dictionaries, data frames, etc.)."
